that embodied in its declaration of absolute
freedom of expression, which makes for a range
broad enough to include every temperament from
the most radical to the most conservative, the only
requisite being that the work should have unmistakable
merit. Each issue will be devoted exclusively
to one individual thereby giving him an opportunity
to present his work in sufficient bulk to
make it possible for the reader to obtain a much
more comprehensive grasp of his personality than
is afforded him in the restricted spaces allotted by
the other magazines. Published monthly, THE
GLEBE will issue twelve books per year, chosen
on their merits alone, since the subscription list
does away with the need of catering to the popular
demand that confronts every publisher. Thus,
THE GLEBE can promise the best work of American
and foreign authors, known and unknown.
</p>

<p>
The price of each issue of THE GLEBE will be
fifty cents and the yearly subscription three dollars.

I never found any use for birth or birthdays, dear comrades,
till I knew what it was to love:
</p>

<p>
I could not tell how successful my life is by the number of
those who love me: I could only tell that by the number
of those I love:
</p>

<p>
I am victorious only when I have won my love of you from
myself: winning your love of me from you is not enough:
</p>

<p>
And so this day though you may not gather me to you I
gather you to me, body and spirit:
</p>

<p>
And so this day I count myself up, not in figures but in
love, and say forgiving and jubilant things to my soul
about us all.

I&rsquo;M SO GLAD I WAS BORN
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">&rsquo;m</span> so glad I was born. It seemed so right
for me to come. And some day it will seem just
right for me to go. Maybe not just yet but sometime.
I dont know whether it matters much
which side of mystery God feeds me on. I am
fed. Here or there, nowhere or anywhere, I am
joyous, a part of things, not to be skipped&mdash;an
atom but for which the stars would not hold
together. That&rsquo;s enough for any sane man to
know about himself. Yet that&rsquo;s not all I know
about myself. I know God made no mistake
making me. Or making you, either. Saint or
scoundrel, making anybody. I can see other
things put aside for my entrance. The Lord said:
Give him a show. So I was piloted to this earth-star.
Nobody specially welcomed me. My father
and mother were there. And a few others.
Some may have been sorry. But luckily I was
there and in my baby way welcomed myself. I
did not rock in that first cradle and say nothing.
Think of the journeys I had lived through and
sung through before I got here. Think of gods
and men and animals and suns and all sorts of
soul stuffs and body stuffs that compounded to
produce me. Is it any wonder I am stuck on myself
after that? I would not be paying great tribute
to what went before or to what is to come
after if I did not stand here now in great pride
and declare the wonder of my flesh and the wonder
of my spirit. I tell you gods are all right.
Yes, and the law of gravitation is all right. Yes,
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
and Beethoven and Socrates and Lincoln were all
right. But how about me? Am I not just as
much all right? Suppose an impossibility. Suppose
I had not been born. Suppose something
had sidetracked me. What would have happened
to eternity? I dont see how Jesus could have
been passed by. Nor do I see how I can be
passed by. God had to do it. When the time
came for me God had no alternative. You might
as well put off to-morrow as put off a man when
his day has come. So I got my size and shape. I
am as big as anything because nothing big or
little could get along without me. I am as beautiful
as anything because nothing beautiful could
be beautiful without me. Do you call yourself a
worm? That&rsquo;s all right if you mean to honor
the worm. But if you mean to abase yourself
then you are unjust to the worm. I never ask
myself: Do you know how little you are? I am
always nudging myself in the ribs and asking:
Do you realize how big you are? Nor how bad
I am. No. But how good I am. Nor how possible
it is for me to fail. No. But how impossible
it is for me not to succeed. So you see
how it is I am glad I was born. You may see how
far back my reasons go. You may see how far
ahead my reasons go. I have trailed no sable
clouds of regret across my past. I drag no obstructing
burden of doubt up to the door of the
future. I keep all ways open to all life. I have
received an inheritance. It crowds me to repletion
with riches. It builds on after all traditional
builders are done. It is fiery with extra-mortal
inspirations. Which all comes with being
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
glad I was born. I hear people speak of being
born right. Was anybody ever born wrong? I
was born incomplete but I was born right. The
complete invites the incomplete. I was not put
here finished. I was put here on the way. I
would be sorry if I thought I was born finished.
A man born finished, his task is done. He could
retire. That would be the mistake. But the
cosmos never errs. The cosmos is process. It is
not end. So I&rsquo;m glad I was born. Glad for the
grief. Glad for the joy. Satisfied to struggle.
To fall in hell and pick myself up in heaven. Satisfied
with the devil in me and the god in me
working off their equal debts. I&rsquo;m glad I was
born. I might go on using words forever saying
that. Yet my account would only then begin to
be paid. I&rsquo;m so glad I was born.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m so glad I was born. And you are one of
my reasons for being glad. You were born, too.
And I hope you are as glad about me as I am glad
about you. I hope you are glad you were born.
They say this is a vale of tears. So it is. It is
also a vale of laughter. And laughter and tears
give life a single purpose. And laughter in tears
is glorious. Do you think I try to hide sorrow
from myself? It sweetens the sap of the tree. I
take sorrow for the uses of joy. I dont let sorrow
get away with the field. I dont let the bad
increase and crowd out salvation. I&rsquo;m so glad I
was born. There&rsquo;s so much work to do. And I&rsquo;m
glad I was born just this time. If I had been
given a choice of all ages I would have chosen
just this age. Not old Greece with all its art
or old Rome with all its conquests or France in
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
eighty-nine or America in seventy-six or sixty-one.
No age of Pericles for me. No Weimar.
No Granada. No Elizabethan era. No age of
privileged exceptions. Give me the Bowery and
nineteen hundred six. Give me the democratic
rule. God anticipated my whim and said:
Humor him&mdash;it wont hurt. So I came along as
well prophesied as anybody. And I know it wont
hurt. It will help. Do you suppose I mean nothing?
Then if I mean nothing God means nothing
and the stars mean nothing and the love in
your heart means nothing. I am not in doubt
about my power and my style. The earth wont
be just the same after I am done. It will be different
and better. I am appointed to make it
better. So are you. Do you not see that plainly
indicated everywhere: So are you? I will not
bray a path into history. Nor fill ostentatious
offices. Nor be recognized as the supreme master
this or that of a profession. But the universe
cant spare me. I, too, must mount the cross.
The universe needs my mediation. I know I was
not produced for nothing. It cost a heap to produce
me. I must catch up with an immense ancestral
obligation. I must make good for my cosmic
bed and board. I have got to prove that the
first atom in faraway time knew what it was
about when it attracted and repulsed and
dreamed towards me. I&rsquo;ve got to justify all of
my ancestors and I&rsquo;ve got to lay my plans so
my descendants will justify me. I must pass
everything on with something added to it. Music
with more music. Painting with more painting.
Good books with more good books. All the
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
noble work of man with more noble work of
men added. No way turning the tide back. With
happiness enough in me to last all the misery
out. With light enough in me to last all the
misery out. With light enough in me to last all
the darkness out. With strength enough in me
to last all the weakness out. Sad, too, for those
in grief. But gladder, too, for those who are
reprieved. Certain that whatever may come no
eclipsing harm can come. Certain that no raindrop
in the universe can lose its way. Certain
that we are jealously cared for though we do not
always see the hand that cares and though that
hand is sometimes cruel. When I see how much
there is in my life to be glad for I forget that
there is anything in my life to be sorry for. I
have no quarrel with the barbarous minute the
hour is so gentle. With the contrary day the
yielding year is so conciliatory. With distorted
ages the symmetry of time is so perfect. I do
not feel like a waif lost somehow in chaos. I am
at home in the midst of order. It seems worth
while to live in a universe that is making, that
has not made, its title. The universe did not do
all its work the first day. It said to itself: I&rsquo;ll
always leave something over for the workers to
do. It said to itself: Traubel will come some
day: leave something over for Traubel. It said
to itself: Or anybody, everybody, millions of
bodies, will come some day: leave something over
for them all. The cosmos is left at loose ends
here and there. That was just meant for you.
Go to work on it. Dont fret and growl. Dont
sit down and cry and tell yourself that it&rsquo;s a
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
rather shameful cosmos anyway and might have
been immaculate if it had chosen to. No. Be a
cosmos yourself. Be a god or a first assistant
or a fourth remove man or somebody and put in a
bit of perfection over your own name. Get into
the nebulous push somewhere. Drag, shove, pull,
lift: do something to add to the active substance
of deity. I&rsquo;m mighty glad so much was left over.
I dont want to send in to the celestial court any
excuse for default. The lords god may say: We
need not worry: our brother is there. The lords
god know what they are about. They know their
brother can be relied on. They may sleep without
bad dreams. Does it ever occur to you to
give the overworked gods a rest and get busy
yourself? The heart&rsquo;s good will should come out
of the heart with gladness on its lips. The song
should be glad it got done. It should lift its
tones in praise. I am glad I got done. I lift my
tones in praise. Creation belongs to gladness.
Can anything that is sorry it was born give birth
to life that will be glad it is alive? Laughter is
the headline and footnote and signature of creation.
When the dream to be a man became a
man cosmos laughed. It was happy. It had done
a creditable job. When a man somewhere lived
love&rsquo;s equal and final life with a woman somewhere
and a child somewhere flamed from the
mutual fire, the sun laughed in kinder beams of
light and the starshine smiled over the cradled
hope. I go everywhere saying I am glad I was
born. It is such an innocent thing to say. It
seems so like a child to say it. Yet I never heard
you say it. I am waiting to hear you say it. I
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
want to hear you say it once. Then I want to
hear you say it always. Get in the habit of saying
it. So possessed you cant help saying it.
No matter who or what says no saying yes yourself.
Saying it to yourself when you are alone,
saying it to us, saying it in silences, saying it out
loud. No: I never heard you say it. I have heard
you read the riot act on creation. I have heard
you growl like a bear and squeak like a rat. I
have heard you tell how bad life is. Not how
good life is: no: how bad. How bad a toothache
is. Not how good a sound tooth is: no: how bad.
There are bleak winds and consuming fires. I
have been frostbitten and burned. Why should
you make so much the most of misery and so
much the least of health? Why should you enter
all the charges and none of the credits? Why
should you not put in a figure or two on the
other side and admit the balance of benefit?
What&rsquo;s the use always going down stream? Why
not also go up with the flood? I am possessed
with gladness. I can see that all the worlds
groan and travail in laughter. I can see that the
shadow laughs in the sun. I can see that the
wrongs laugh in the right. I can see the greeds
that destroy laugh in the generosities that save.
I can see all that is crooked in the social order
laughing itself into all that will be straight in
the social order. Over all I prevail: I, too, god
by heritage, recreating the forever recreated
stars. I, too, adding more gladness to the multiplied
gladness of time. I, too, pouring out of my
limitless stores limitless streams of rejoicing. I,
too, an equal maker and sustainer of undoubted
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
life. I, too, smiling back order into any chaos.
I, too, always merry and rejuvenescent. I who
am so glad I was born.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m so glad I was born. I like to tell about
that. I like to say it to people who want to hear
and to people who do not want to hear. I like to
tell it to the man who is about to give up. I notice
that he begins again. I like to tell it to the
musician who thinks his inspiration is all gone. I
notice that now he writes the finest songs ever. I
like to tell it to the lover who is not loved. I notice
that he is afterwards satisfied to love, not
crazy to be loved. I like to tell it to the man who
is robbed and to the man who robs. I notice that
both hear me right for both see that it is better to
be robbed than to rob. I like to tell it to the sick.
The sick take hope. The sick, too, say: We are
glad we were born. Glad to be born even if born
to sickness. (Though no one is born to sickness.)
And gladness is forever the footway of dreams. I
can go to the injustices of the world with my joy.
I am not afraid that the injustices can refute my
joy. For injustice never can refute justice. My
jubilant rhapsodies will prevail. They will go
where nothing else will go. They will go where
arguments will not go and figures will not go.
They will go where logic will not go and law will
not go. They will go where the pride of faith will
not go and the humility of faith will not go. They
will go where the sun will not go and the rains
will not go. I say I&rsquo;m glad I was born. I am
good seed for any ground. No soil could be so
bad my seed is not good for it. I am good will
for any life. No life could be so poor my seed is
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
not rich for it. I am the victorious day that
comes after every other day has come and failed.
I am the courage that comes after every other
resolution has come and failed. I am everything
true that comes after everything false has come
and failed. I am the conquering work of your
brains and your hands that comes after all other
work has come and failed. I&rsquo;m so glad I was
born. Glad for the universe. What luck it was
to the universe the day I was born. I feel that
the universe was full paid all old credits that day.
I came. I do not hesitate to tell anybody how
magnificent I am. I do not try to divert attention
from myself by calling attention to the earth
that is so many miles through and the sun that
is so many degrees hot. I let the devastators do
that. I see how much more than their less I
amount to. Earths and suns are only a meager
per cent. to the plenty of my exaltation. You
cant take earths and suns to your heart. But
you can take me to your heart. You cant take
your degrees and decorations to your heart. They
always fall short of solace and must fall short.
But you can take me to your heart. I never fall
short. You cant take your position in society to
your heart. You cant take your overcapitalized
name to your heart. You cant take your riches
to your heart. Oh, you cant take your riches, all
your thousands, all your houses, all your swell
possessions, to your heart: and they cost you
much. But you can take me to your heart, you
can take my eyes that see and ears that hear to
your heart, you can take my announcements of
immortal life to your heart: they never default,
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
never fall short: and they cost you nothing. I
guess I have said all I can say about that. I have
got so far in my raptures now I have got beyond
words. You must get the rest without words.
I&rsquo;m so glad I was born.

And so I have been set apart to deal honestly with man

PANKHURST
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">P</span><span class="postfirstchar">ankhurst.</span> The world has been saying that
word under its breath and over its breath. You
have been saying it. The papers have been saying
it. It has been on the lips of professors and
agitators. It has been made fun of and been
shuddered over. Maybe you have thought it was
the name of a woman. So it was. But it was
more than that. It was the name of a revolution.
As the name of a woman it would mean nothing
in particular. As the name of a revolution it becomes
prophecy and history. That&rsquo;s why the
people who put the woman in jail found that they
couldn&rsquo;t put the revolution in jail. And if you
cant forcibly feed a woman how much less likely
you are to forcibly feed a revolution. That single
word of two syllables. It cuts into prejudice
like the blade of a knife. A woman&rsquo;s name. Say
it over to yourself. At first it may sound commonplace.
But keep on. Say it over and over.
It will become marching armies. It will become
martial music. It will trumpet you to vast victories.
Women don&rsquo;t need to say woman now.
They only need to say Pankhurst. You tell
me I am talking of an arrogant woman only
a few feet high who is bent upon destruction.
Yes: I am talking of her. She is the gateway
through which I pass. But I am also talking of
the revolution which is so high no vision can
reach its summit. Pankhurst is a dream come
true. Pankhurst is an ideal in action. This
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
law. She&rsquo;s inveterate. She asserts, she summons,
she demands. Yet she&rsquo;s calm. She: the
mother incarnate. She&rsquo;s the maternal made revolution.
She&rsquo;s sex. Women don&rsquo;t all recognize
her. They are dubious. But she proceeds and
says nothing. She asks no favors and gives none.
She dont apologize. She asks nobody&rsquo;s forgiveness.
She makes no palsying explanations. She
goes on and on. Just as gravitation goes on and
on. Just as time goes on and on. My eyes never
stop with the woman. I pass to that by which
she is fortified. Listen to what she says. Do
you belittle her message? Return: listen again:
weigh her grave confessions. Every word she
says is the word of revolution. Dont you think
you&rsquo;ve been warned enough? Get your impudent
property out of the way. That infernal property.
It interrupts the vision. But for it we&rsquo;d go
straight to our end. Pankhurst. I heard her
speak the other night. It was in a hall. Thousands
of people were there. She was on the big
stage in the half dark. She spoke to us. The
great building disappeared. The woman who
spoke and those who were spoken to disappeared.
I was left alone with an idea. The pure, the
undefiled, idea. Revolution. Are you afraid
now? Is the mother in you afraid&mdash;or the
father? Or is the child in you afraid? Do you
shrink back with horror from this issue? You
dare to acknowledge mothers. But are you afraid
of the maternal? You dare to say woman. But
are you afraid to say revolution? Woman is
offering no petition. She is not saying her
prayers. She is not humbly beseeching anybody
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
for anything. Woman is vehemently afoot full
armed marching victoriously across the earth exacting
tribute making light of the phantom obstacles
that formerly drove her back into the
lambpit. If I say Pankhurst I say all of you not
one of you. The great auditorium disappeared.
I was alone somewhere with an idea. Her
phrases are the least of her. Revolution is the
most of her. What she was there before my eyes
making a speech was as nothing compared with
what she became to me in the unseen and the
silences. I am awed. The revolution becomes
flesh. The revolution becomes woman. She
sailed across the ocean in a ship. She put her
name on the ship&rsquo;s register. Revolution came in
another name. And the registry registered it in
another name. Then they didn&rsquo;t want her to
land. Some of them. They didn&rsquo;t know her by
her real name but even as it was they felt that
her ominous entrance promised no good. Revolution
waited for revolution. Woman waited for
woman. Have you gone about all these years
supposing woman wouldn&rsquo;t finally strike her
blow? She waited till it was time. The woman&rsquo;s
day is here. The man&rsquo;s day, too: for man can
have no day without woman nor woman without
man. Many of you still tremble. You&rsquo;d rather
she hadn&rsquo;t come. But it had to happen. The
revolution was due. You harbored it under disguise.
She set it out in the open. You didn&rsquo;t
want to acknowledge how big round it was. She
refused to hide the fact from itself. You were
the disciples of revolt. Or the partners. Or the
revolutionary faithfuls. But she was more. She
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
was revolution incarnate. She was the godmade
woman sent to earth to proclaim the future.
There you have it. Not a mere woman. Though
a mere woman is no more to be made light of than
a mere man or a mere cosmos. Yet not a mere
woman. That, surely: then infinitely more than
that. Revolution. Pankhurst.
</p>

<p>
Pankhurst. The shadow on the horizon. The
black darkness gathering overhead and around.
The threatening forefinger of fate. The menace
of maternity. The uprising of a sex. The comrade
woman challenges the wife woman. It must
be resented. We must throw back the waves of
the sea. Here is another revolt against property.
These people too put people first. How monstrous.
To put a woman or a man first. To
put a mother first. We must teach mothers their
place. And people too: we must teach them their
place. The death of a man or a woman: what is
that? But burning down a house: that is an
attack on civilization. These new women want
everything. They treat husbands as if they were
no more than men. They treat property as if it
was dirt under their feet. They say nothing matters
but hearts and love. Well: hearts and love
are not bad if you keep them where hearts and
love belong. But if you bring hearts and love
into politics or economics then you are invading
a forbidden sphere. We&rsquo;ve got to set back the
clock. Time&rsquo;s going too fast. A man said: I
dont like it. I asked him: Dont like what? He
said: This woman business. I asked: What
woman business? He said: Woman in politics.
I asked: Dont you think they&rsquo;re capable of politics?
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
He exclaimed: My God, yes: too capable!
I asked: Then why do you kick? He said: Because
if they go into politics they&rsquo;ll make this a
woman&rsquo;s world and I dont want to live in a woman&rsquo;s
world. That&rsquo;s it. When the woman becomes
real they dont want to live in a woman&rsquo;s
world. Just as profit-believing people don&rsquo;t want
to live in a man&rsquo;s world when a real man appears.
If this is not a mother&rsquo;s world whose world is it?
The man said: I dont want to live in a woman&rsquo;s
world. Just as profit-believing people dont want
from their own side: We don&rsquo;t want to live in
a man&rsquo;s world. Yet if this is not a father&rsquo;s world
whose world is it? You dont want the world the
women will make it possible for real fathers to
live in. You don&rsquo;t want the world the men will
make it possible for real mothers to live in. You
say: Half a world&rsquo;s a good enough world for me.
You say: A whole world&rsquo;s too big for me. Then
you hear the reply. Then you see the reply.
Words reply. Mobs reply. Conflagration replies.
Quarrels, battles, reply. This still water
of man&rsquo;s peace has been ruffled by woman&rsquo;s tempest.
Things were going on so good. Then
these sexless rebels had to come. Just as money
says to people in the economic sphere: Things
were so serene: then you had to come. Yes,
something always has to come. Every time orthodoxy
settles itself for a long tenure something
has to come. Just as clear days are getting
used to themselves stormy days come. We had
things arranged just about right. It wasn&rsquo;t ideal.
We acknowledge imperfections. But on the
whole it was about right. Woman was just about
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
where she ought to be. Labor too was just about
where it ought to be. Then something happened.
Something always does happen. Labor got to
growling. And now woman&rsquo;s got to growling.
Woman. Haven&rsquo;t we given woman the choicest
tidbits of life? And yet she says no. She says
that would be all right if something else was first
all right. That something else is her freedom.
Is her claim to herself. She says that comes
first. Why: that&rsquo;s just what labor is saying.
We&rsquo;ve got to fight labor. We&rsquo;ve got to fight
her. It&rsquo;s in fact one quarrel with two wings.
And we&rsquo;ll crush them with one answer. We&rsquo;ve got
to or this world&rsquo;ll go to pot straightaway. If it&rsquo;s
got so that a man&rsquo;s got a right to be a man
through a woman&rsquo;s right to be a woman. If it&rsquo;s
got so that a woman&rsquo;s got a right to be a woman
through a man&rsquo;s right to be a man. If that&rsquo;s so
then I want to know the reason why. This whole
liberty stuff is nonsense. Don&rsquo;t you see how it
is? My God! If this keeps up the first thing you
know this&rsquo;ll be a liberty world. Look at it honest.
Dont you see it yourself? Reason it
out in your own mind. Every other consideration
will be set aside. Democracy will run homes,
business, states, everything. Horrible. This will
be a liberty world. And I dont want to live in a
liberty world. Pankhurst.
</p>

<p>
Pankhurst. When I hear you say that word
I can tell what you think of yourself. I dont
have to ask you for other evidences. Whether
you lift your voice or drop it. That tells the
whole story. Whether there is any mother in
your voice. Whether there is any love in it.
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
You&rsquo;re not dealing here with a person. You&rsquo;re
dealing with a race. The person comes and goes.
But the new day; it comes and never goes. Now
and then the world names a new star. All the
glasses are lifted towards the revealed luminary.
There&rsquo;s the clamor of those who see it and those
who half see it and those who dont see it at all.
You cant know Pankhurst by reading the personals
in the newspapers. You cant get acquainted
with her by taking the stories of her
life for what they literally say. She brings all
that woman can bring. Then she brings what
was before and what is after. If you have the
great person theory you&rsquo;ll not understand why
she is here and what she has accomplished. But
if you have the great race theory the clouds&rsquo;ll
wash out of the skies and you&rsquo;ll see the sun. We
have long said: Man shall hold no property in
man. The women come along now and say:
Man shall hold no property in woman. Then
I go farther. I go to the end. I say: Man shall
hold no property in property. What are you
listening for? It&rsquo;s a great voice. Women are
not primarily voters. They are women. They
are sex. They are mothers. The maternal is
speaking up for itself. Votes for women. That&rsquo;s
the mere surface of the stream. Souls for women.
Bodies for women. That&rsquo;s the far cry.
Every woman has a father in her. Every man has
a mother in him. That which has been confined.
That shall be released. That which has been refused
woman. That she demands. That which
woman has refused herself. That she will resume.
A great flame lit in a vast shadow. That&rsquo;s
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
what it all is. This little woman overflowing
with calm vehemence: what is she? Just the
mother of two daughters? Just the wife of a
dead husband? Just a prisoner in British jails?
That&rsquo;s the average of her. But that&rsquo;s not the
most of her. She reaches out over the earth.
She ceases to be a person. She becomes a presence.
She who can be measured becomes the
immeasurable. My eyes sweep her inspiring horizons.
I follow her lead. Let her go where her
feet and her wings take her. Down anywhere,
up anywhere. Resisted no matter how, welcomed
no matter where. Every mile she travels is sacred
to a common trust. Dedicated to a universal
purpose. Are you skulking? Do you
worry the years away with quibbles? Rather
that every atom of property should go up in
smoke if the people are left. Rather anything
than that the soul should pay the bills of property.
When men are victims you say: We are
saved. When dollars are victims you say: We
are ruined. You can brush aside a man or a
woman. But you cant alter the will of the fates.
You can turn your back to the sunshine. But
you cant stand in the way of the sun. You can
take the splash of the sea. But you cant stop
it from rolling up the shore. You can lock yourself
in your house. But you close the rest of
us out. When the man comes what has the woman
got to say? When the woman comes what
has the man got to say? The answer of the man
is found in the woman. The answer of the woman
is found in the man. The woman has the
floor. She asks her pertinent impertinent questions.
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
She asks whys and wherefores. You exhibit
your tax receipts in reply. She asks you
what you are. You answer by showing her what
you have. You think you shine through what
you own. Far from that. You can only shine
through what you dont own. This little woman
has made all your big fortunes look mean. This
little idea has made all your big theories look
cheap. Everything else always does look insignificant
when a real man or woman comes round.
When you shook hands with this woman you
more than touched the palms of life and death.
When you looked into her eyes you read more
than the tablets of Sinai. When you heard her
speak words you listened to more than the music
of waters and winds. When you measured her
and weighed her you tested more than the sizes
and shapes of starry universes. The woman
comes. Oh man: what has the woman in you
got to say of it? The man comes. Oh woman:
what has the man in you got to say of it? Pankhurst.

I have met men and women and men and women: they are

WHAT IS THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN?
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">hat</span> is the color of your skin? Are you a
child of the sun or a child of the snow? Do
you come with red in your face? Or is there a
shadow across your head? Are you the white child
of a black mother or the black child of a white
mother? I see your brown red right hand. How
warm it feels to me. I look into your glowing
equatorial eyes. How like being led to fathers
and mothers that is. You bring me north south
east west. You guide yourselves to me. You
distribute me among yourselves. I am your child
no matter how. Your child no matter where.
There are seas everywhere. But there is no sea
between us. There are interfering miles of space
and hours of time. But they dont break us from
each other. I was born of my mother and here
I am. You were born of your mothers and there
you are. The earth was born of the sun. The
sun was born of what? I mix up the elements.
I come out one place. You come out another
place. From the same mother womb. From
the same father seed. To the same brother earth.
Do you hold a noose over me? Or drop a sword
from above as I pass? Or shoot me down in
my tracks? Or pass laws of which I&rsquo;m the victim?
Or lock your housedoors when I knock?
My credentials are the same as yours: no better
than yours. I am the harvest of the same planting:
no more than that harvest. Like you I have
one life to live on one earth before I pass on. Do
I stand on my icy heritage and freeze the heat
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
out of your love? Remember the stream: go up
with it to its sources: go down with it to the sea.
Every atom dancing in the light or clouded by the
storm advances and retreats in perfect equity and
perfect order. Dear prouds and humbles: by
God I&rsquo;m yours and you&rsquo;re mine. Do you believe
that anything can take you from me or take
me from you? I meet you. I read about you.
I am told all the terrible truths. But everything
draws me nearer. Nothing drives me away. If
you could be less to me than I am to myself then
I would have to be more to myself than I could
be to you. That would violate my democracy.
That would be setting one thing above another.
When I elevate myself with all I am a democrat.
When I lift myself above the rest I am a tyrant.
Listen to me. You who are reading what I write.
Maybe you are black. Maybe you are pink or
white or yellow. Maybe you are between or
across. All that goes with maybe. But when
you are my brother there is no maybe to it. If I
could look at any man and not see his mother as
my own I&rsquo;d be false to all motherhood. If I
could look at any woman and not see her father as
my own I&rsquo;d be false to all fatherhood. I&rsquo;m not
satisfied with one mother. I want all mothers.
Nor with one father. I want all fathers. Nor
with my children. I want all children. I&rsquo;m not
satisfied with one color. I want all colors. Nor
with one race. I want all races. Nor with one
language. I want all languages. My hunger is
fiercely universal. I&rsquo;m not fed till I&rsquo;ve eaten at
every table. I can only know one woman by
knowing all women. I can only know one people
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
by knowing all peoples. What is the color
of my skin? What is the sound to the song?
What is the water to the ocean? That&rsquo;s what
the rest of me is to my exterior. That&rsquo;s what
the substance in me is to my show. That&rsquo;s what
my foundations are to my rooftree. There at the
bottom we are together. And at the top: there
we are together. We begin together and end together.
But we are alienated in the journey.
When we start out in the morning we say good
by. When we meet again at night we ask: How
do you do? What wrenched us apart in the struggle
of the pilgrimage? Why should those who
are friends before and friends again after be enemies
while they travel? I say to the other-colored
peoples: You have to be my brothers whether
you want to or not, thank God. Do they say
to me: You have to be my brother whether you
want to or not, thank God? What is the color
of your soul? What is the color of your skin?
</p>

<p>
What is the color of your skin? I see. You
are a nigger. You are a damned dago. You are
the man on the other side of the wall. The man
over somewhere. The yellow peril. The ignorant
dirty emigrant. The two for a quarter six
for a half dollar mill slave. There is a border
line between us. There are incomes between us.
There is a whole code of manners between us.
You are the godforsaken polack. You are the
hooknosed jew. You are the monkeyfaced irishman.
You are the beerguzzled deutscher. I call
you names. I can&rsquo;t see you. You are in the next
yard. The stars look just as well from the next
yard. But I insist upon the exclusive astronomy
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
of my own garden. I smell your stale clothes. I
am choked by the aromas of your foul kitchens.
Would you like your sister to marry an african?
I&rsquo;m not fussy. I&rsquo;m only a man. A white man.
I don&rsquo;t draw lines ferninst you. I only draw
lines in favor of myself. Do you mean to say
you think these ignoramuses as good as yourself?
Do you tell me that you&rsquo;re no better than the
herd? Nonsense. There&rsquo;s the nietzschean word
for it. The average man is the herd. The awkward
big-fisted loon. The idiot crowd. The people
everybody kicks. The folks everybody despises.
The men women children you wouldn&rsquo;t
invite into your home. I use them. Ride them.
Make money off them. But that&rsquo;s all I want of
them. Just the robber money. Not the man love.
Look at them filing to work tired to start with.
Look at them filing back from work like a funeral
nearly dead to end with. They&rsquo;re a rum lot.
They&rsquo;re worth a hundred cents on the dollar and
up in the labor market. They&rsquo;re worth about ten
cents on the dollar and under on the social plane.
My God! but they&rsquo;re a scabby bunch. It makes
me sick to see them. Look at them as they work
their treadmill. Don&rsquo;t they give themselves
away? Right and left, north and south, look
where you choose: they are the slobbering tobaccoey
stay-behinds and passbacks of the dumpheap.
Every mother&rsquo;s son of &rsquo;em useful to me
maybe but useless to themselves. Down in their
luck, to be sure. But sentenced for life just the
same. The jackjohnsons of society. The refuse
of birth and death. The clods. The dullards.
The heavyfooted and heavyheaded bowlegs and
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
knock-knees. The slave asses yoked to an inescapable
burden. Who are you that you dont
belong? Are you of us few or of their very
many? Are you of the interest bearing rent
collecting profit class or do you fester in these
maggoty bottoms of fate? Stay where you fall
no matter how far down you are. Dont try to
climb. We shove you all over the cliff again.
We throw dust in your eyes. We confuse you in
clouds of verbiage. We disarm you. We have
laws to make you afraid. We have creeds to
make you hopeless. We have poets who kill you
with pensive despairs. Do you dare aspire to
anything? Stay where you are in your deep
mud. There is no above to you. No beyond.
No ease. No dreamworld. You were condemned
before you were born. You remain condemned
while you live. And you will continue condemned
when you become the dung in the barnyard
at last. A woman heard me expressing my
race faith. She asked me: &ldquo;How would you
like to have a grandchild with a black skin?&rdquo;
That was it. That was the whole devilish poisonous
story. The entire problem prejudice in a
nutshell. She didn&rsquo;t ask: How would you like
to have a grandchild with a black soul? That
would have meant something. But she wasn&rsquo;t
interested in souls. She was interested in skins.
How would I like to have a grandchild with a
black skin. What is the color of your skin?
</p>

<p>
What is the color of your skin? Maybe you
have a black skin and a white heart. Maybe you
have a white skin and a black heart. I dont
know. We talk about the yellow peril when we
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
think of Asia. And we talk about the brown
peril when we think of Italy. And we talk about
the black peril when we think of South Carolina.
But all of us are afraid to talk of the white peril.
I see no perils. My arms reach out to all. I
want the Chinaman to possess himself of the
earth if he&rsquo;s an earth man. Let him freely pass
right and left testing himself and us. Dont put
up pennywise barriers built on poundfoolish
laws. Rather do anything than stop your fraternities
short of the total census of man. Every
interfering sea, every contradicting statute, every
counterchecking prejudice, every adventure in
money-making, that nullifies the international inference
is a slap in the face of brotherhood.
Damn up the human stream. Then you damn
down the soul. The old negro mammy in Georgia
asked me as I left: Will you do something for
me? I said: Yes, if you&rsquo;ll do something for
me? She asked: Will you kiss me good by? I
said: Yes&mdash;on condition that you kiss me good
by. I would only be worthy to take if I was
worthy to give. I&rsquo;d say to all the world: I would
only be worthy of loving if I was worthy of being
loved. I would only be worthy of being an American
if I was worthy of being a Jap. I would
only be worthy of serving if I was worthy of
being served. I would only cease being a peril
if I ceased calling others perilous. How could I
be worthy of being a white man if I was too good
to be a black man? Ethiopia cries out loud to
Scandinavia. India cries out loud to England.
All the peoples cry out loud from everywhere to
all the peoples. There is no peril in peoples.
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
There is only peril in you and me. There is no
peril in anything that brings any of us together.
There is only peril in what keeps us or drives us
apart. I go with mothers fathers children. I go
with birth and death. I go with dreaming and believing.
I go with mixing and mating. These are
the same everywhere. The same with you black
and me white. The same with my skin burnt to
fire and the same with your skin frozen to the
whiteness of snow. The same with duskies and
palefaces. I dont go with maps. With geographies.
With diplomacies. With kingdoms and
republics. With genius aristocracy pauperism.
With success and the main chance. I only go
with people. With folks. And with them I go
anywhere they go. Into any hell or any heaven.
Into any hope or any despair. With people.
Where people go I may go too. But where people
are refused there I am shut out. The woman
asked me: Would you like to have a grandchild
with a black skin? She brought her question to
the wrong court. She should not have addressed
it to me. She should have taken it to God.
Would God like to have a grandchild with a
black skin? It&rsquo;s as though we asked God: What
would you think of yourself if you happened to
be black or red? What is the color of your soul?
What is the color of your skin?

YOU WRITERS
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">Y</span><span class="postfirstchar">ou</span> writers who are trying to write. You artists
anywhere who are trying for art. You who
may be successful but have not arrived. You who
hold yourselves in a class apart and play the
game of temperament. You fools, liars, ornamenters,
hypocrites, prostitutes, of words. You
who wouldn&rsquo;t sell your bodies but who sell your
souls. You who have taken to the street for
profit. You who hunger for flattery and thirst
for fame. You betrayers of the people. You
who put words on yourselves as chains. You
who are goods to the highest bidder. All of you.
I have something to say to you. You may have
said it to yourself. But I&rsquo;m going to say it anyhow.
Both for your good and mine. Something
serious. Something that goes to the root. I&rsquo;ll
talk right out. For somehow you who might be
are not. You to whom a trust is given have betrayed
it. I believe in the sacredness of the word.
I want words to be gods, paradises, service. I
want words to live. I want words to be creators.
Some writers are so vital they cant say and or
the or but without thrilling you. There are some
writers so dead they cant say immortality without
a funeral. I want the living word. How
can I get it? By using words instead of being
used by words. By speaking out of my heart
instead of out of books. By not trying to write.
By living. Some authors write as if they never
had been born. They say: I did my best. I say:
Rather your worst. When you talk to me face
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
to face you are worth every minute. When you
talk to me on paper in a book you are a waste
of time. What happens to a man in the period
between what he feels and what he does? What
catastrophe occurs? Why does he go to smash
in the process? He is so alive in what he humanly
and so dead in what he professionally
says. What is the poison that comes between?
Money? Prestige? Or is it some false principle
of art? Do your words, do your colors, do your
tones, take you away from rather than towards
your inspiration? You try too hard. You
shouldn&rsquo;t try at all. An artist&rsquo;s sketches are wonderful.
His finished canvases are commonplace.
His sketches are impromptu. His paintings are
designed. He did the sketches. The paintings
did him. He didn&rsquo;t try in the sketches. He was
all try in the paintings. You writers who are
trying to write. Are you trying to live? I admit
your display. I admit your phrases. But you?
Do I admit you? Yes. But not the you you
get into your books. My words belong where
my heart is. I am not willing to feel one thing
and write another. Let me be the servant of my
emotions. Down below all my words is all my
life. Rooted in the soil. Established in the
unalterable laws. Dedicated to the supreme inferences.
If my words dont say that they lie
about me. I am the fact the words are supposed
to report. If they dont express me I go unrepresented.
I dont try to be anything. I just let
myself be whatever results. It would be as bad
for me to force myself to be something as for me
to force myself not to be something. There are
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
so many artists and there is so little art. There
are so many writers and there is so little writing.
There is so much painting and there are so few
pictures. We are overclothed. Our wardrobe
is rich. We are jeweled. We are placed on
thrones. But what are we anyhow? We are
humbug kings. We are fraud citizens. What
we are not we are. What we are we are not.
The same thing which makes some men look for
social prestige makes an author look for literary
prestige. We give up the same things for it. We
lie and duck and play sycophant for it. We fool
people. We make black white and white black.
We trifle away serious things. And we are serious
over trifles. All for what? In order to appear
to be what we are not. We are masqueraders.
Words are the tools of our burglary.
Words are the cant of our religion. Words are
the sophistry of our law. Words are the fog we
lose our way in. We&rsquo;d be safe if it wasn&rsquo;t for
words. Words are our peril. Words are the obstacles
in the way. If you want to be understood
dont talk. Whatever you have to say,
dont trust it to words. Try not to try. Cut
loose. Throw the reins on their necks. I see
many books. And yet there is only one book. I
see the broad highway and the countless journeyers.
Where are they all going? The girl looks
at herself in the glass. She wants to be pretty.
A little paint and powder is added here and
there. A few words are added here and there.
It&rsquo;s all the same thing. You bribe, steal, seduce.
You make use of words not for the purpose of being
true but for the purpose of being beautiful.
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
Show: that&rsquo;s what you want. Distinction: that&rsquo;s
what you want. To be considered clever. To be
a best seller. To go into many editions. To be
invited to lecture in colleges. To be asked to
write for the magazines. To be in demand. That&rsquo;s
what you use words for. So as to be listed in
the literary four hundred. So as to be set apart
somehow. You want to be extraordinary. It has
got so the writer stands above and condescends.
He don&rsquo;t stand below and look up. He regards
the people as pawns. He&rsquo;ll use them in the game.
But he won&rsquo;t concede their equality. He plans
for so much a year. He figures at receptions.
The colleges give him titles. He dont want to
be average. He wants to be exceptional. So he
tries to write. He gives his writing little pulls
and twists so as to adjust it to the market. He
takes words off here and puts words on there because
he wants his disguise to be complete and
impressive. Go look at the books in libraries.
They are the endless roster of the dead. Most
men bury themselves in books. Only occasionally
does a man resurrect himself in a book. He
makes his writing the parade. It marches with
brass bands. Everybody knows it&rsquo;s coming. And
everybody knows of it after it&rsquo;s gone. But nothing
can make it live. Active as it seems to be
it&rsquo;s still a burial. You who have tried so hard
and have not succeeded may yet learn that he
only succeeds who dont try at all. When you
try&mdash;that means that you&rsquo;re up against it. When
you&rsquo;ve got to engineer. When you&rsquo;ve got to
watch your ps and qs. When you&rsquo;re afraid you&rsquo;ll
not know how to turn a sudden corner. Then
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
you&rsquo;re no use. Then you&rsquo;re firing in the air.
You&rsquo;re to discover how to win without caring
whether you win or lose. You&rsquo;re to find out that
you&rsquo;ll arrive without worrying over the process.
He is surest who dont ask for pledges. Words
are a fatality. You writers who are trying to
write.
</p>

<p>
You writers who are trying to write. You
who&rsquo;d do anything rather than be thought of no
importance. You who&rsquo;d murder the language or
rape it or rob it or do anything to it rather than
not make your point. You: what have I to say
to you? Just what I have been saying. Go on
with your dance. Get what you can out of the
disgraceful scramble. Poke your heads into the
slop trough. Let me paraphrase the man who
advised his boy to get money. Make books.
Honestly if you can. But make books. Try
for points. If you cant make them on the square
make them on the foul. Try to write. Dont try
to think. Dont try to love. Dont try to serve.
Try to write. Get a reputation. Never mind
your character. Do everything you can to convince
everybody that you are what you know you
are not. A man has to make a living. Therefore
he has to do what he has to do to get it. So you
have to be notorious. Therefore you have to do
what you have to do to get notoriety. If you
have to murder your mother to get success murder
your mother. What&rsquo;s one mother to one success?
If you have to starve children in factories
to get success starve children. What are a few
children out of so many? You are the spokesman
of life and death. You can be hired for so
<a id="page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
much per to aid and abet the orthodoxies. Sell
your soul. What is one soul, even if it&rsquo;s your
soul, to one success? Your words. You can
turn them into nugget values. You can set a
high figure on them. And you can hypnotize
the purchaser. Not a word without pay. This
is a world and a time of bargain and sale. Make
the world pay. Watch the market. See what it
wants. Give it that. Try to conform. Try to
write not your soul&rsquo;s words or your heart&rsquo;s words
but trade&rsquo;s words. Give the verbal stock market
all the preferences. Everybody else sells whatever
he can. You have words. Words are your
only treasure. Why shouldn&rsquo;t you sell words?
And you will sell the words that are according to
fashion not the words that are according to truth.
Just as the rhyming lilting poets write the words
not of faith but of formula. If the issue is between
the rules and the exception the rule has to
go. Write book words. And write pretty words.
Even if the ugly word says more than the pretty
word choose the pretty word. Be an artist. Work
for the art result. Whatever you do, dont work
for the human result. Keep your eye on alphabets
and words and sentences. Dont let your
eye wander off to life. If you give your spirit
any liberties it&rsquo;s liable to play the bull in the
china shop and smash your fine wares into a
tragic litter. You want to know whether I&rsquo;d
seriously advise such treason. I say yes. Why
not? You are an artist. You are not a man.
You want me to price you by art standards. You
dont want me to price you by human standards.
The art standard might just as well be crooked as
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
straight. It might just as well be a whore as a
woman. It might just as well grovel and snuff
and wallow as aspire and soar. The crook says:
Dont judge me by the human standards. He
wants to be judged by the crook standards. And
from the crook standards why shouldn&rsquo;t a crook
be a crook? The writer says: Dont judge me
by the human standards. He wants to be judged
by the writer standards. And from the writer
standard why shouldn&rsquo;t a writer be a writer?
Artist or crook. Crook or artist. It&rsquo;s the same.
People think it wrong to steal money. But they
dont think it wrong to steal words. The only
word that belongs to the writer is the word that
belongs where it&rsquo;s put. If it dont belong there
then it&rsquo;s stolen. It&rsquo;s far worse to play false with
words than to play false with money. Money?
The next dollar may purify the money account.
Words? Words may be prostituted forever. But
dont let that discourage you. Make good even
if you have to make bad. I cant see any other
way out for you. Let the worst in you do its
best for you. Dont be too squeamish. Remember
that it&rsquo;s all dirty business anyway. Every
step you take is a surrender. Down, down, into
bottomless confusions you sink yourself. You
haven&rsquo;t grown into art. You have built yourself
into art. You haven&rsquo;t written out of people and
life. You have written out of scholars and books.
You have committed in words all the felonies of
the calendar. But because they are words you
haven&rsquo;t felt guilty. You say: They are only
words. Why should a man be expected to be
scrupulous with words? You might as well say
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
of love: Love is only love. And you might as
well ask: Why should a man be expected to be
scrupulous with love? If the right word pays
use it. But if it&rsquo;s more profitable to use the
wrong word, use that. You express every horror
of the white slave traffic. But what shall we
say of the word slave traffic? There are houses
of bondage. And there are books of bondage.
Writers say words. But only a writer rare among
writers says the word. Who is the criminal? The
man who steals goods or the man who violates a
thought. What are you doing with words? Giving
them to life or giving them to death? Making
them counterfeit or keeping them genuine?
Not trying to get life from words? But rather
giving life to words? You merchants in words.
You traders of dreams. You who are always trying
for art but who never try for love. You who
always estheticise with the elect but refuse to
fraternize with the crowd. You who go the way
the wind blows. You who yield to art the tribute
of life instead of exacting for life the tribute
of art. You who are the climbers. You who
would give up your souls for a phrase. You who
would rather write a pretty sentence. You who
would rather have a style. You who would
rather be classified with the intellectuals. You
who whatever you are beg, borrow or steal your
way into eminence. You distorters of scripture.
You criminals of words. You parricides of gospels.
You executioners of discovery. You smotherers
of freedom. You writers who are trying to
write.
</p>

<p>
You writers who are trying to write. Stop trying
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
to write. Then you can write. Live. Let
the writing take care of itself. Trust yourselves
to moods. Trust yourselves to words. Trust
yourselves to what may happen. Then something
worth while will turn up. The man who argues
about his sins is sick. The artist who argues
about his technique is sick. That accounts for
all the dead books. A man who&rsquo;s busy telling a
story is spending no time wondering how his English
is. I wouldn&rsquo;t advise you to study to be an
artist? No. I&rsquo;d rather have you study not to
be an artist. If you&rsquo;ll only let yourself alone
your art will come. And if you&rsquo;ll only let your
art alone your life will come. In that perfect result
your spirit will triumph. But if you interfere
with the fine balance either way you&rsquo;ll nullify
the victory. Sometimes when I see all the
liars of the world I wish all the books might
have remained unwritten. But sometimes when
I read a great book I see how even all the little
books are excused. The man who tries to live
generally dies. But the man who is indifferent
to life becomes immortal. The super man is the
man who&rsquo;s superior to life or death. The super
book is the book that&rsquo;s superior to technique.
The super merchant is the merchant who&rsquo;s superior
to buying and selling. Super writing is the
writing that&rsquo;s superior to authorship. You are
not to be curious about writing. You are to just
write. You are not to be curious about the reward.
You are to just take what comes. If
you&rsquo;re prosperous you&rsquo;re to ask: What&rsquo;s wrong
with me? And if you&rsquo;re a failure you&rsquo;re to ask:
Do I deserve such honor? You are not to say:
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
I&rsquo;ll put a book into my life. You&rsquo;re to say: I&rsquo;ll
put a life into my book. You are not to produce
a work of art. You are to produce a work of life.
You may have to give up your best adjectives.
Or maybe your largest nouns. Or maybe a virile
verb or two. To get what? To get life. You&rsquo;ve
got to give up everything to get life. The whole
language if necessary. The whole fabric of delicate
grace. All the flowers of speech. All the
rhymes and lilts. All the niceties of manner and
the assurances of routine. They must all go. All
effort must go. You&rsquo;ve not only got to be free of
the alphabet. And not only free of the traditions.
And not only free of the cliques. But you&rsquo;ve got
to be free of effort. You&rsquo;ve got to cease trying.
You&rsquo;ve got to get where you have stopped caring
or not caring. My call is for indifference. I say
you are not to go round humble about what you
dont do and proud about what you do do. Life
dont call for arguers and hairsplitters. Do what
you cant help doing. Refuse to do what you
can help doing. Ease up on your nerves and
your ambitions. Desire is richest in the absence
of desire. A man&rsquo;s lungs dont ask any questions.
They just breathe. His feet walk. His eyes
open and shut. Shall a man&rsquo;s art do less? Shall
it consume itself in quibbles? Shall it dress itself
according to the mode? Or shall it stay in rags?
You cant have both things. So which will you
have? You cant advance and retreat at the same
time. So which will you do? Can you imagine
yourself neither alive nor dead? Can you see
yourself neither anxious nor not anxious? Can
you conceive of yourself as staking all and staking
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
nothing on the survival of a book? No man
can become an artist short of that. No artist can
become a man short of that. Nirvana to technique.
Oblivion to rules and traditions. Letting
the soul retreat to nebula every time it
wishes to advance to creation. Starting all over
again with every word. Making every word again
the first word. Are you to refrain from scheming?
Yes. You are to let the waters flow unto
their normal levels. You are to let the law take
its course. The law of words. The law of books.
A man may get into the way of looking too much
into himself. A book may have a man&rsquo;s fault. It
too may brood too much. Most every book that
ever tried to be a book has gone bankrupt. And
most every book that didn&rsquo;t worry whether it was
a book or not has won a place in the human circle.
It&rsquo;s an awful thing for a man to want to
be good. It&rsquo;s as awful as for a man to want to
be bad. It&rsquo;s an awful thing for a man&rsquo;s style to
want to be a book. It&rsquo;s as awful for a man&rsquo;s
book to want to be a style. It&rsquo;s terrible to want
to be the worst man in the world. But it&rsquo;s far
more terrible to want to be the best man in the
world. You writers who try: you must keep on
trying till you get beyond trying. The man who
tries: he may sell out: he may go into the market
with his equity. But the man who&rsquo;s got past trying:
he&rsquo;s unshakably defiant. You fraud rhymers.
You humbug versifiers. You dictionary hunters.
You users of crooked words for straight. You
professors and poets. I call on you to stop trying.
I dont want to hear any more of your
claims. I only want to hear of your love. I
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
dont want you to waste your time naming yourselves.
I dont care what you are called. I am
only interested in what you are. You make me
sick trying to be clever. Now make me well not
trying to be dull. I&rsquo;m as tired seeing you try to
write as I&rsquo;d be seeing you trying not to write.
I want you to quit. I want you to get where you
couldn&rsquo;t sell if there was a buyer and where no
one else could buy if there was a seller. I want
to see you who have been in verbal bond set spirit
free. I want to see you who have given up all
the life you know for words willing to give up
every word you know for life. You writers who
are trying to write.

ALL THE ENGINEERS PERISHED
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">ll</span> the engineers perished. The ship went
down. Some were saved. Some were lost. The
rich were mostly saved. The poor were mostly
lost. But the engineers: they all drowned. They
all stuck to their posts. Not one of them lived
to tell how the rest died. They had no chance to
tell the world about each other. How heroic they
were. How they nonchalantly smoked their pipes
as they stood waist deep in water. How they
cracked jokes to the last. They just stayed below.
They took their medicine. They may have
squealed. God knows. But they didn&rsquo;t run.
They kept the lights burning as long as their
hearts kept beating. Who has told their story?
Let me tell it. While you are busy with the
somebodies let me speak of the nobodies. While
you are celebrating the people with names let
me celebrate the people who have no names.
While you are trying to estimate how much
money went down in the cabin let me try to
figure how much manhood went down in the engine
room. While you are counting up the gods
who are not men let me count up the men who
are gods. It may be easy to die with the band
playing and the world looking on. But to die in
the stillness with no one looking on may be a bit
more solemn. I&rsquo;m not against dying. Dying
has its points. Dying may be the surest way
to life. Nor am I against living. Living too has
things to be said for it. Living may be the noblest
way to death. But I want to say things
<a id="page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
about these men and boys I never saw. I want
to say things about all the men and boys I have
never seen. The world over, everywhere, yellow
or black or white; the men and boys. I
want to call the attention of forgetful people to
the crowd. The crowd itself forgets the crowd.
It was sad to have the crew die. It was sad to
have the steerage bunch die locked in a hole.
But that wasn&rsquo;t half as sad as to have the crowd
on shore more curious about the millionaires who
died than about the paupers who died. I&rsquo;m not
drawing lines on heroes. I&rsquo;m not worrying about
heroes anyway. I&rsquo;m thinking of people. My
heart is drawn to people. It dont hurt what they
wear. Let them wear velvet or canvas. Do you
suppose I care whether they&rsquo;re bad or good?
Rich or poor, they&rsquo;re people. Every man belongs
somewhere in the crowd. Do you suppose
I care whether he&rsquo;s at the top or the bottom?
When the boat went to pot people went with it.
Some because they had to. Some because they
chose to. I cant separate the heroes from the
cowards. So I accept them all as people. When
I read of the fifty engineers that perished I felt as
if fifty gods had been snuffed out. People talk of
a man or two or of a few dozen men as if their
death was only a soso bit of news. To me dying
seems sense enough. I can see how we might get
used to dying and enjoy it. But we shouldn&rsquo;t
waste people. Our civilization is jealous of property
and prodigal of people. I cant see such
waste with equanimity. I want to save people.
There&rsquo;s such use for people. They are so precious.
They are our brothers. I want my brothers.
<a id="page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
I dont like you to drown them cruelly in
the sea. I dont want you to destroy them in
railroad disasters. I hate your wars. They rob
me of my people. What do I care about your
balance in bank? One man&rsquo;s life is worth all
balances in bank. Even a mean man&rsquo;s life? Yes.
Any man&rsquo;s life. I pass the derelicts on the street.
They are thrown aside. They have no right in
the stream. If they raise a protest they are
called to order. The police tell them to move on.
And the priests do too. And the statesmen. The
stores and the factories say move on. There&rsquo;s no
place for them to rest. They&rsquo;re hounded across
the earth. So the engineers perished. No one
said much about it. They took the engineers for
granted. Did they take anyone else for granted?
They always take the poor for granted. They
expect them to be heroes. And they expect them
to die without a growl. If they growl they are
in a panic. If they say: You die too, they are
ungrateful. If they refuse to die they are set
down for cowards. Or maybe killed. They do
die. They are sacrificed everywhere. They give
up their lives for everybody and for each other.
Trainmen. Sailors. Soldiers. They are all set
up to be shot at or starved. The women who
scrub the floors. The mothers who wash our
clothes. They die for us. These engineers died
for us. Fifty-three of them. Gods who kept a
world moving. Gods who stood by the law. Laborers
keep our world going. They&rsquo;re always
dying for us. Dying for everybody. With no
decoration. No medals or shoulder straps. Their
names dont get into the papers. They get no
<a id="page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
hero badges. Poems are not written to them.
No one says: He died like a gentleman. No.
Laborers are so busy dying like men they have
no time to die like gentlemen. They just get a
little line or two when the time comes. All the
engineers perished. That sort of a line. Just a
statistical record without adjectives. Just a
farewell without gunfire. Just a shrug of the
shoulders. Three hundred nobodies were buried
in a mine. Three hundred mere men. Three
hundred dirty Italians perhaps. Three hundred
nobodies the slaves of one somebody. Were they
heroes? No one cares. No one even asks. The
world is not curious. They take care of the
world. Like the gods. They do everything. They
are the providence of all alike loafers and workers.
But they remain anonymous. They live a
little while and die for good. They are not names.
They are numbers. It&rsquo;s not John this or Stephen
that or William the other. It&rsquo;s twelve men. The
story dont list them. The story says: Twenty
died. The next day the story says: Two more
have died of their wounds. Nobodies. Died to
save you and me. And yet they are despised.
Not buried in consecrated ground. Though consecrating
the ground they are buried in. Or
the sea. The nondescript atoms of destiny. Lost
in the cosmic shuffle. My brothers. My lovers.
Given to the sea when it was not hungry and
asked nothing. My darling comrades. Stolen
from me when I had a right to them. I tried not
to see the big letters in the paper. But it was
too plain to be avoided. All the gods of the machine
went down. All the engineers perished.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a>
All the engineers perished. All the coal miners
were choked to death. All the children took sick
in the factories. All the girls in stores fainted
and had to be sent home. While you&rsquo;ve been
looking for heroes I&rsquo;ve been looking for women
and men. Women and men are good enough for
me. Being a man or a woman is far harder than
being a hero. I can find you heroes but they are
growing scarce. The heroes are not improving
any. But the men and women are improving all
the time. The heroes are on top. They dance on
the roofs of the world. But the men and women
are the foundations. They are not heroes. They
are men and women. When things happen they
are of course scared. All brave people are scared
in danger. Only the cowards have no fear. Only
the blind and deaf and loveless are heroes. A
man has a right to be scared. And a woman.
That dont mean that they run or do anything
shameful or ridiculous. It only means that they
know what they&rsquo;re up against. But they stay
where they belong. They take care of things.
Of this world. They remain in the shadows.
Work on horror-struck in the darkness. Face
death trying to beg off in the dead of the night.
The men and women. Who are you who build
on men and women? Who put your palaces on
their backs? Who make them carry your burdens?
Who suck them dry? You are heroes.
You strut in spectacular places. You are heroes.
But you rob them while they sleep. You are
heroes. But you hit them in the back. You are
heroes. But you lock them in the steerage and
let them drown in a box. Yes, you lock them in
<a id="page-54" class="pagenum" title="54"></a>
the steerage. You have made the labor world a
steerage. You have locked all the laborers in.
They live and die without hope. They are jailed
in your profits. Your incomes turn the key in
the door. How can they get out? Your world
is for the cabins. There are no boats for the
steerage. The boats are for those who live without
working not for those who work without
living. No poor man has a right to live. Existing
should satisfy him. This is not a world
of live and let live. It&rsquo;s a world of live and let
die. The heroes own the world that the people
make. It takes time to be a hero. People have
no time. They must work. How could the
heroes be heroes if the people stopped working?
So the people are not heroes. They&rsquo;re only men
and women. They dont ornament the world.
They just feed it. They just nurse it along
through its sicknesses. They just do everything.
Men and women are the ground the heroes walk
over. They are the treasure all the incomes are
drawn from. They are the ragtag and bobtail
who are everything and count for nothing. The
heroes got the band playing. No band plays for
men and women. A princess in England had a
baby. Parliament was about to congratulate her.
Keir Hardie said: Yes, do it. But he also said:
Let&rsquo;s condole with the widows and <a id="corr-4"></a>children of
the miners who were blown to death to-day.
Hardie had no taste. They all told him so. The
papers told him so. And the em pees. And the
priests of the church. And scholars in colleges.
They agreed that Hardie had no sense of decorum.
For they were congratulating a hero. A
<a id="page-55" class="pagenum" title="55"></a>
princess mother. But he was only condoling
with men and women. What do a hundred mere
men miners amount to compared with one titled
baby hero? This world is not made for men
and women. It&rsquo;s made for heroes. It&rsquo;s true
it&rsquo;s made by men and women. But that&rsquo;s no
matter. Making a world is one thing. I can see
that. Letting the fellow who didn&rsquo;t make it
possess himself of it. Dont you see that&rsquo;s another
thing? Resisting his invasion would be
treason. Every man can see that too. Dont
you see it? If you fight for what dont belong
to you you are a hero. If you fight for what
does belong to you you are a coward. How could
a bricklayer be a hero? Why, the very word is
against it. Bricklayer. How could such a word
describe a hero? But gentleman. Ah! that&rsquo;s a
word now. That&rsquo;s the real thing. It&rsquo;s natural
for a gentleman to be a hero. But no man could
accomplish such a distinction. A man would first
have to become a gentleman before he could in
turn become a hero. So the men have given it
up. And the women. They take a back seat.
They retire before the grandeur of an impossible
reputation. They just keep on doing what they
have always done. They keep on working and
dying. They go down in ships. They starve.
They get maimed by machinery. They look
heavy and stunned. They are stubborn. They
make good in their jobs. But they are never mistaken
for heroes. No one points them out on
the street for heroes. They bob along like ordinary
atoms. Like ordinary sunlight. Like ordinary
air and water. They are not visited by the
<a id="page-56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
great or asked to serve on committees. They
just stay ordinary. They just remain like ordinary
food and shelter. Like ordinary love and
hate. Like ordinary gods. And after a while
they perish. They all perish. Like the engineers.
Doing last what they did first. Keeping
their appointments. They die ordinary just as
they lived ordinary. Not even aspiring to be
heroes. Not referred to as honorable misses and
misters anybody at all. Not spoken of as though
a man or a woman was dead. Spoken of as if a
number was wiped off the slate. These men and
women who perish being only men and women.
Just as the engineers who perished were only engineers.
</p>

<p>
All the engineers perished. Did you ever meet
a hero? I have met heroes. But they never wore
medals or labels. Did you ever meet a martyr
who was conscious of martyrdom? I have met
martyrs. But they never knew who they were.
And I never told them. Heroes dont hunt for
you. You have to hunt for them. The hero is
not the sun. The hero is an atom in the sun. If
light was conscious of being light it would cease
to be light. I know countless heroes. But they
never say anything about heroism. Life is not
heroism. Life is life. One man has more life
than another man. He is not better than other
men. He is only more alive. He weighs more.
He looks farther. But he is no hero. A man is
affronted if you call him a hero. He would rather
just be a man. I think of a certain man. He was
nonchalantly the most effective man I ever met.
Was he a hero? He never went anywhere theatrically
<a id="page-57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a>
to do anything. He just stayed where
he was and acted his part. The engineers just
stayed where they were and acted their part. As
the simplest workman does. As the scavengers
do. Just acted their part. Can a god do more?
Should a man do less? I don&rsquo;t say there are no
heroes. I say they are countless. You see the
hero in the exception. I see the hero in the rule.
My hero never flourishes a whip. I see him serving.
Let my hero stop serving and he abdicates.
Dont believe anything the hero tells you about
himself. Sure things dont insist on their reality.
Every man has his place. Do you call a man a
hero for staying in his place? If I heard anybody
call me a hero I&rsquo;d begin to suspect myself. I&rsquo;d
take my size and shape over again. I&rsquo;d go forty
days into the wilderness. I&rsquo;d bury myself in the
slums. I&rsquo;d want to get away. To be where I&rsquo;d
escape the measurer. I see the heroes everywhere.
But I see no hero. I see people in their
places everywhere. Often most beautifully in hideous
places. Often most hideously in beautiful
places. Like the engineers they all serve. Like
the engineers they will all finally perish. Like
the engineers they will all reappear somewhere
again. Heroes? The heroes work underground
and overhead unheralded and unseen. The heroes
make our shoes. They work in the trenches.
They nurse babies. They take care of the world.
They make it dirty. And they clean it up. They
are its crowd. They are the mobs. They are
the herd. They are the mass. They are all
always called by all names but their real names.
They are called dangerous. But if it was not for
<a id="page-58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>
them nobody would be safe. They are called ugly.
But if it was not for them nobody would be graceful.
They are called stupid. But if it was not
for them nobody would be enlightened. They
are the eclipsed, the obscured, the submerged.
But if it was not for them nobody would be a
genius. And you sometimes speak of them as
cowards. But if it was not for them nobody
would be brave. You repeat it often enough as
a matter of course that if it was not for the light
there would be no shadow. Let me say it once
for all the other way. That if it was not for the
shadow there would be no light. I&rsquo;m glad. I
look everywhere. I discover no hero. I look
everywhere. I never fail to discover heroes. All
the engineers perished.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">hat</span> are you doing for the cause? Not for
yourself. For all. Not to keep yourself going.
To keep the race going. What are you doing
for to-morrow that you didn&rsquo;t do yesterday for
to-day? I dont say for what cause. I say for
any cause. I dont ask you what you are doing
with tasks I might set you. I ask what you are
doing with tasks that you yourself set. I know
what you do in eating and working at your trade
and sleeping at night. You do that in order not
to die. Everybody does that. I ask you what
you are doing in order to live. I know what you
say. I read what you write. I have heard your
promises. But this is not enough. This hardly
tells me what I want to learn. I know what you
do with what you have to do. I want to know
what you do with what you dont have to do. I
can see how your pay may make you think. I
want to know how you make your pay think. In
short, I know what you do as a slave. What I
want to find out is what you do as a master. Did
I say master? Yes. Master of yourself. I never
feel like accusing anybody. Like sitting in judgment
on anybody. Down in my heart I acknowledge
the last compassion. Rather anything than
that I should forget your priority. Every man
somehow belongs first to himself. Do I say that?
Yes. Then I say something more. He also belongs
first to the race. He stands for personality.
There he&rsquo;s for himself. He stands for
service and progress. There he stands for the
<a id="page-61" class="pagenum" title="61"></a>
race. I cant interpret his moods or his impulses.
I can guess them. But their interior purport is
beyond the reach of my vision. That is why I
ask: What are you doing for the cause? And
that is why I say: I shall not say what cause.
The cause has done everything for you. What
are you doing for it? In all the past it has been
doing something for you. Now you have come.
You have inherited its accumulations. What are
you doing for it? I hear you say you dont see
what you&rsquo;ve got to be thankful for. I dont
charge you with ingratitude. I only ask whether
you are grateful. I dont even say you should do
anything for the cause. I only remind you of
what the cause has done for you. I dont ask you
whether you have done your duty. I only ask
you whether you feel that you have a duty. I&rsquo;m
not presenting a bill to you. I only ask whether
you owe a bill. The cause has run an account
with you. Do you run an account with the
cause? Again you ask: What cause? And
again I say: I wont name the cause. That which
is the holy of holies to you. That is your cause.
That which you say must come before what you
put into your belly and on your back. That
is your cause. That which demands sacrifice.
That which insists upon its initial sanctity. That
which persuades you more than anything else.
That is the cause. I dont suggest the cause to
you. You suggest it to me. Therefore I have
the right to ask you that question which your own
confession leads up to. You dont have to answer
to me for it. You have to answer to your life for
it. There&rsquo;s no appeal from the cause. It&rsquo;s the
<a id="page-62" class="pagenum" title="62"></a>
last court. It says the closing word. What can
you say when you have defaulted? When you
have done nothing for the cause? When you
have simply existed and not lived? No man
owes anything to a world to which he cant feel
related. If you are an alien. If you are a cosmic
vagrant. If you are lost. If you think of
yourself as debris. Then you are not responsible.
Then I dont wonder that you deny your
heritage. But if in any rapt moment of inspiration
you but once catch the face between the
clouds you are from that time the servant of the
eternal. Then there&rsquo;s no excuse for pettifogging.
Then you can no longer disavow your responsibility.
What are you doing for the cause? For
the beyond? For the next step? Are you giving
up anything for it? Or are you asking it to
give up something for you? Do you pray to it for
favors? Do you want cash down? Or are you
willing your grandchildren should collect? Do
you sell the cause like you sell goods? And
if it&rsquo;s profitable do you bless it? And if it&rsquo;s
profitless do you curse it? When I ask: What
have you done for the cause? I dont refer to
anything that you&rsquo;ve had visible pay for. I refer
to something that there&rsquo;ll never be any visible
pay for. The cause is always in the darkness
ahead. It&rsquo;s always the path unbroken. It&rsquo;s always
the rough of fate. It&rsquo;s always the veil. Always
the curtain. Always the shrouding mystery.
Do you serve it for pay or work for it with
love? Do you want to get life from it or do you
give life to get it? One man says God. Another
man says Cause. Any name might be any other
<a id="page-63" class="pagenum" title="63"></a>
name so it means the same thing. When I see
what you do or dont do I know whether you are
only a <a id="corr-5"></a>boarder on the earth or whether the earth
is your home. I know whether you are a brother
among comrades or a chance acquaintance among
enemies. What are you doing for the cause?
</p>

<p>
You are doing nothing for the cause. You are
making a living. But you are not making life.
You are personal. You have not surcharged
yourself with the general inspirations. Your motive
is profit not service. You want to get ahead
no matter how. You dont want to stay behind
no matter why. Let anybody suffer. You mean
to rejoice. You dont make way for the world.
The world makes way for you. Service is not
master. Profit is master. Downing someone
else. Making good because someone else makes
bad. That is your code. Staying alive no matter
who goes dead. Sponging on life. Loafing
on others. Taking anything you can any way
you can get it. Accepting none of the odium of
the cause. Shrinking from anathema. Avoiding
unpopular opinions. Letting anyone do the work
of progress. You doing nothing. That&rsquo;s the
code. Others queer themselves for an idea. Do
you? Anything but that. You pat them on the
back. But you sneak the price. You encourage
them to go on. But you dont go on with them.
You scab on the revolution. They put up their
lives. You put up nothing. They die that you
may live. You live that they may die. It&rsquo;s bad
enough to scab on the body. But it&rsquo;s infinitely
worse to scab on the soul. You are strike breakers.
You undersell. Just as you undertalk. Just
<a id="page-64" class="pagenum" title="64"></a>
as you underspend. Just as you underact. You
hear the cause defamed and say nothing. When
the battle is on you are nowhere to be found.
You dont even carry water. You scab on your
brother. You scab on your age. You are the
revolutionist gone to wood. There&rsquo;s no flower
on your stem. You let the others do the fighting.
But you claim your share of the spoils.
You say: These theories will be all right some
time. But that some time will never be your
time. My ears know your voice. I can tell
when you are around though you say nothing.
Little as you know it, I follow you through all
the intricacies of your psychic retreats. Do you
think you can cover your tracks? Right or left,
up or down, in or out, across or around: wherever
you go I tally you. Every step you take is within
my horizon. Do you resent my inevitable attendance?
You say: I mean the same thing you do.
And you say: I am with you, only not so fast.
You say: You can count on me, too, but not too
soon. You say: You can depend upon my good
will, but not too far. You&rsquo;ve always some reason
for holding back. Some reason for not putting
up money or service. Some reason for withholding
your confession. Somebody is always too
violent for you. Too extreme. Too exacting.
Too inevitable. You want at the same time to
be and not to be. You let other men queer
themselves for you. You see them lose their
reputations. You know they put their livings in
the scale for the cause. But you dont raise a
finger to help them. You hug your poor life as
if it was rich. You husband your prostituted
<a id="page-65" class="pagenum" title="65"></a>
treasure as if it was righteous. You let them
work for all while you work for yourself. You
are the master scab. You are the scab left over
after all the other scabs have been beaten. And
you not only scab on your contemporaries. You
scab on your grandchildren. You scab on the
future. You are sold out. You are pinkertoned.
You have betrayed the crowd. You are one thing
when you think and another thing when you
live. You are one thing in what the world knows
you for and another thing in what you know
yourself for. You are the shot from the rear.
Our enemies challenge us face to face. But you
knife us in the dark. You are the margin of
faithless revolution. You are the interior force
which flings us into the clutches of reaction. I
meet you every day I live. You pat me on the
back. You congratulate me. You do everything
but avow me. You are half a revolutionist minus
a whole revolutionist. You dont scab the labor
market. You scab civilization. You scab the
army on the march. You create the panic of
battle. You put the poison in the soup. You
take all and give nothing. You beg what you
cant borrow. You borrow what you dont want
to steal. You steal what you dont mean to work
for. You are the scab of the revolution. You
do nothing for the cause.
</p>

<p>
What are you doing for the cause? You do
everything for the cause. You work for the
cause as the sun sheds light. You dont hunt
places in which to hide yourself away. You hunt
the open and there face the world. You dont
wait to hear someone else say the word first.
<a id="page-66" class="pagenum" title="66"></a>
You say it. You dont ask anybody to try the
water to see if it&rsquo;s cold. You try it. And you
dont care if it is cold. You&rsquo;re as ready to spend
your last as your first cent. Some people are always
wondering what other people will give
them. Some people are always wondering what
they&rsquo;ll give other people. But the lover dont argue
about himself. He loves. Nor do givers argue
about themselves. They give. They are niagaras
of benefaction. They dont know it themselves.
They have to be reminded of it. Nothing
so surprises a great man as the idea that he
amounts to anything. Nothing so startles the
generous man as the idea that he is liberal.
Nothing seems so impossible to the hero as the
idea that he is courageous. My heart has no
shall I or shall I not. I am not allowed to play
any yes and no game with myself. Listen to
what I say. Down in me where I&rsquo;m deepest
there&rsquo;s no hissing snake&rsquo;s-nest of alternatives.
Run your knives clear through me and I wouldn&rsquo;t
do but the one thing. Every drop of my blood
flows the one way. Down over that steep cliff
goes all my love, which is all my life. I never
spend a minute trying to find out what my duty
is. There is no duty. I&rsquo;m just driven. There
is no duty. I just keep on. When I say cause
I say sun and stars and earth and air and food.
I say love and those I love. I say that which
makes life and is made by life. If I hesitated an
instant there would be no cause again. There
would be only empty space and hourless time.
If I drew back one inch order would revert to
chaos. That which is not worth all is worth
<a id="page-67" class="pagenum" title="67"></a>
nothing. If I said I&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;d be lost. If the
tides said they&rsquo;d see. If the storm said it&rsquo;d see.
If yesterday said to to-morrow that it&rsquo;d see. If
birth said to being born that it&rsquo;d see. If dying
said to death it&rsquo;d see. If Etna&rsquo;s fires said they&rsquo;d
see. If the ices of the north said they&rsquo;d see. If
a fragment of an atom said it&rsquo;d see. It&rsquo;d be the
same as if I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;ll see when my name is called.
If I left it to my purse to see. If I left it to my
properties to see. If I left it to my prospects or
my privileges to see. Then I&rsquo;d not see at all.
I&rsquo;d be stone blind. If I said that the cry of the
scab is the voice of God. If I said that the chorus
of the dollars is the psalm of paradise. If I
said that the prayer of apology is the savior of
souls. Then I&rsquo;d not hear at all. I&rsquo;d be stone
deaf. What are you doing for the cause? Do I
want you to be a fool for the cause? Yes. That&rsquo;s
the only way you can be wise for yourself. Do I
want you to give up facts for dreams? Yes.
That&rsquo;s the only way you can turn dreams into
facts. Do I want you to give everything to the
poor? Yes. That&rsquo;s the only way you can become
rich to the crowd. I dont want you to put
your hand into your pocket and take it out empty.
I dont want you to put thought into your brain
and take it out empty. I dont want you to put
love into your heart and take it out empty. I
don&rsquo;t want you to say to the cause: I&rsquo;ll think it

out over night. I dont want you to say: I may
help some but dont expect too much of me. I
dont want you to say: I&rsquo;ll ask my wife or my husband
or my father or my mother or somebody. I
<a id="page-68" class="pagenum" title="68"></a>
dont even want you to ask your own spirit. I
want you to act. I want you to answer before
the question is put. I want you to spring before
the challenge is issued. I want you to warm up
before the fire is lit. Do I want you to go out
cold nights when you might stay home and be
comfortable? Yes. More than that. Do I want
you to take your fortune in your hands and go do
something impossible? Yes. More than that.
Do I want you to choose misery maybe in place
of joy? Yes. More than that. Do I want you
to stake your life on the issue? Yes. More than
that. I want you to do more than all that. I
want you to do more than debate and quarrel and
wonder and waver even if you decide right in the
end. I want you to go on as if you had nothing to
do with proceeding: I want you to surrender as
if you had nothing to do with yielding. I dont
want you to wait till you are called. I want you
to call. Whenever anything goes short: I want
you to step into the gap. I dont want you to
ask: How can I? I want you to say: I couldn&rsquo;t
do anything else. What are you doing for the
cause?

I CLAIM EVERYTHING
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> claim everything for the people. And everything
is not too much. The individual has got
to learn to say: I am the people. And the people
have got to learn to say: We are the individual.
Everything springs from the people. Everything
goes back to the people. I&rsquo;m not interested in
suns. I&rsquo;m interested in people. Mountains and
moons and trees have no meaning to me until
they are peopled. Your philosophies and dreams
are insignificant till they are peopled. I know
nothing but people. I comprehend nothing but
people. If you sing a song I hear people in it.
If you paint a picture I see people in it. If I
didn&rsquo;t hear the people or see the people I might
as well be deaf and blind. If you tell me there
are so many rivers in a country or so many acres
of ground and ask me: What do you think of
that? I say: I dont think of that: I only think
of people. If you name the great men to me and
ask: What do you make of them? I answer: I
make nothing of them: I make everything of the
people. If you ask me: What do you read in the
book? I reply: I read the people in the book.
I am at home where people are. I am alien where
people are not. There&rsquo;s no use trying to get me
to approve of anything that dont include the
people. That which dont include the people is
empty. Just as a man&rsquo;s heart if it does not
include the people is void. I am drunk with
the crowd. I am bathed in the mass. I give myself
to the common stream. I dont want to be
<a id="page-71" class="pagenum" title="71"></a>
found somewhere off alone. I want to be lost
somewhere off alone. I want to be lost somewhere
in the crowd. I never feel so pinioned as
when I&rsquo;m alone. I never feel so free as when
I&rsquo;m in the crowd. The crowd is my father and
mother. My eyes are not enthralled by sunsets
and seastorms. I want people: only people. Let
me have people and I&rsquo;m happy. Deny me people
and I&rsquo;m defeated. Rich as a man&rsquo;s soul may
be in its own right a man&rsquo;s soul is incomputably
richer in the people&rsquo;s right. Every time I wander
from the people I feel as if I am choosing a
vacuum for my inheritance. Dont you see how
it is? I draw all my checks on the people. My
personal signature is not valid. I have no account
with myself. I can never overdraw my account
with the people. You say: God said: Let there
be light. I say: The people say: Let there be
light. You talk about inferior people and superior
people. I see no superior people and no inferior
people. I see only people. When I say
people I dont say good and bad. No: nor geniuses
nor fools. No: nor the saved and the
damned. No. When I say people I only mean
people. I dont mean whites or blacks or Hindus
or Americans. I mean people. If I say that the
world belongs to people I don&rsquo;t mean a few owning
for all or all owning for a few but all owning
for all. If I say the people are divine I dont
mean divine people. No. I only mean people.
The people are divine but there are no divine
people. So when I say I claim everything for
the people I dont mean everything with exceptions.
I mean everything without exception. I
<a id="page-72" class="pagenum" title="72"></a>
dont owe the good people as separated from the
bad people. I owe both. And I owe the bad
people more than I owe the good people. For
the good people have been good for themselves.
And the bad people have been bad for me. I
claim everything for the people because the people
are everything. I make no claims for the
green grass and earthquakes and shipwrecks and
arts and the will of the majority. Such incidents
are secondary. My claims are all for the
people. After you give me the people I have
everything else. But if you refuse me the people
then I have nothing at all. If your theories dont
give me the people. Or your governments. Or
your sciences. Or your vast cities. Or anything
you build or pride yourselves upon. If they dont
give me the people they are a fraud against which
I revolt. But if they give me the people then I
return you a receipt in full. I want people. I&rsquo;m
willing to go without anything. Without what
you poorly call riches. Without what you weakly
call power. Without what you obscurely call
distinction. I&rsquo;m willing to go without all that if
you&rsquo;ll only give me people. Any people. The
rough and tumble average. The nonchalant
non-elect. The noisy quiet brutal kind crowd.
Though I am dashed to death against its rocky
shores I surrender myself without equivocation
to the furious sea. Everything is not too much.
I claim everything for the people.
</p>

<p>
You claim nothing for the people. Nothing is
not too little for the people. You lock your doors
to keep the people out. You lock your heart to
keep yourself in. You say dollars. I say people.
<a id="page-73" class="pagenum" title="73"></a>
You say kings and Presidents. I say people.
You say the sculpture of Greece, the paintings
of Italy, the music of Germany. I say people.
You say: But for them. I say: But for
these. You point out a few figures lost in the
distance. I direct you to the crowd at your elbow.
You say one and another. You say somebody.
I say all. You say fame. Intermediaries.
Middlemen. Interpreters. I say people. You
are eminent for a while by reason of what you
take. But I say no one can be eminent for good
except by reason of what he gives. You think
the people need saviors. I say the saviors need
people. The people make money for you. You
spend money for the people. The people make so
that you may have. You dont make so that people
may have. You give me leaders. I give you
people. You say the leaders lead. I say the
leaders follow. That the people lead. Leaders
would be useless without people. People would
still be people without leaders. You say brain
should be paid extra. I say nothing should be
paid extra. That pay should not be for talent but
for need. What a man needs. That should be
his pay. What a man contains. That should be
what he gives. A witty man said: The more I
see of men the more I think of dogs. I will say
that in another way. The more I see of those
you call the somebodies the more I think of those
you call the nobodies. We live in an age of
saviors. I am looking for an age of people. The
saviors are multitudinous. The priest takes your
soul. He&rsquo;s going to save your soul. The plutocrat
takes your body. He&rsquo;s going to save your
<a id="page-74" class="pagenum" title="74"></a>
body. You see, they&rsquo;re going to save you by
destroying you not by fortifying you. So they
seize the pictures to save art. And the operas
and symphonies to save music. You are to be
saved by being denied everything. If they gave
you anything you&rsquo;d be lost. They are safe from
luxury no matter how much they have. You are
in peril of luxury no matter how little you have.
They fool you with their paraphernalia. You
are awed not by their brains but by what they
tell you of their brains. You take their word
for it. You should take your life for it. You
are willing they should enjoy for you. Should
travel for you. Should eat and drink for you.
Should play games for you. What have you for
yourself? Resignation. Remember that text
which has been immemorially the solace of the
robber. The poor you have with you always. You
must have the poor with you always because you
must have the rich with you always. Who would
save the poor if the rich didn&rsquo;t? And if the poor
were not saved what would become of the rich?
The great you have with you always. You must
have the little with you always because you must
have the big with you always. It wouldn&rsquo;t do
to wipe out the distinctions. To fill in the gap.
That chasm is kept impassable by the hand of
providence. You cant live for yourselves.
Someone must live for you. You cant live for
yourself. You who dig in ditches. You who
work in mills. Harry Thaw must live for you.
You who eat at lunch counters. You cant live
for yourself. The fellow who dines at the St.
Regis: he must live for you. Every time you try
<a id="page-75" class="pagenum" title="75"></a>
to live for yourself some savior interferes to live
for you. You&rsquo;ve got to keep yourself thin to keep
him fat. There&rsquo;s no other way to sustain the
delicate balances of destiny. The church will live
for your soul. The state will live for your body.
You find all the saviors waiting to live for you.
Insisting on living for you. Refusing to let you
live for yourself. Taxing you to death to crown
themselves for life. You have thought of the
saviors dying that you might live. Think again.
And you will see yourself dying that the saviors
may live. My life is the people&rsquo;s life. I no more
die for the people than the people die for me.
Look the saviors straight in the face. Defy them.
Refute them by an appeal to your own treasure.
Every time by an appeal to your own treasure.
Every time you save yourself you destroy a savior.
Do you want to be saved by another?
Better be damned by yourself than saved by another.
What is the price of salvation? Your
body and soul are the price. You are to give up
everything. That is the price. Not give up everything
to all. No. That would be a fair price.
Give up everything to the saviors. That is the
price. That is the pirate fee. What is the price
of salvation? Your alleys and gutters and prostitutes
and factories and premature death are
the price. At every doorway stands a savior.
He charges you for going in. He charges you for
coming out. Profit is a savior. You pay its toll.
Rent is a savior. You pay its toll. Interest is a
savior. You pay its toll. What is left after you
have settled with the saviors? The saviors are
left. But nothing is left of you. Nothing is
<a id="page-76" class="pagenum" title="76"></a>
not too little for the saviors. You claim nothing
for the people.
</p>

<p>
I claim everything for the people. And everything
is not too much. What do the people claim
for themselves? So far they have claimed little.
They have let the saviors give them religions.
They have let the saviors give them economics.
They have stood aside to let the saviors pass.
Instead of making the saviors stand aside to let
the people pass. The saviors have given them religions
which were blasphemies. The saviors
have given them economies which were robberies.
The saviors have been. The people are to be. The
people are next. Now the people will give the saviors
religions which are reverent. And they will
give the saviors economies which are justice. The
saviors used to succeed. Now you may notice
that the saviors fail. The saviors only succeed
when the people fail. When the people succeed
the saviors fail. Saviors belong with kings and
owners and bosses. When the people at last object
to being ruled or owned or bossed the saviors
will disappear with the saved. The mendicant
and the millionaire are symptoms of the same disease.
The savior and the saved are symptoms of
the same disease. The superior person and the
inferior person are symptoms of the same disease.
The capitalist and the laborer are symptoms
of the same disease. They require only one
treatment. You cant get one without the other.
You cant <a id="corr-8"></a>rid yourself of one without the other.
The people dont need saviors because they dont
need to be saved. You cant save people for the
same reason that you cant damn people. The
<a id="page-77" class="pagenum" title="77"></a>
people are people. That&rsquo;s the answer to all the
saviors. The people are themselves enough answer.
People intoxicate me. My eyes see people.
(I dont acknowledge things.) Look for,
find, abandon themselves, to people. Dont acknowledge
saviors. Reach out to, are reached
out from, people. Everywhere I meet the threatening
saviors. Do you shrink in the mire till
you can borrow wings to take you to heaven?
I know the black in the people. But the black
in the people is not the people. Even the white
in the people is not the people. The hate or
love in a man is not the man. The man is the
man. The people are the people. It&rsquo;s stupid to
say that. It&rsquo;s like saying a cloud is a cloud. It&rsquo;s
like saying a star is a star. But what else can be
said? Time and space are time and space. Can
you damn or save time and space? The people
are the people. Can you damn or save the people?
You might as well tax the skies as tax a
man. As well assume to save the sun for pay as
save the people for pay. As well pretend to
be the necessary middleman between Jupiter and
the moon as between people and <a id="corr-9"></a>people. I make
the whole claim because I have the whole faith.
And everything is not too much. I claim everything
for the people.

TO LEAVE NO DOOR UNOPENED
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">o</span> leave no door unopened. To pass freely
in and out. To leave no heart unopened. To
leave no life unopened. To get everything between
out of the way. To make it possible for
desire to reach across the gap. That is your
business and mine. That is what we owe ourselves
and each other. To make light of boundary
lines. To efface barriers. To abolish tollgates.
All civilization is the opening of doors.
All art is the opening of doors. And science.
It, too, is the opening of doors. We have been
out of sight of each other. Too many of us sit in
perpetual executive session. Most of us exclude.
We dont include. We close ourselves in somewhere.
We look down and up but we dont look
face to face. Not because we dont trust others.
Rather because we dont trust ourselves. We
think the trouble is with them. The trouble is
with us. We withdraw. We get away. Crawl
into holes. Into incomes and fames. Crawl into
them and draw the covers over. We dont welcome
life. We shrink from it. We never keep
open house. We live in prisons and we are our
own jailers. We are not trying to live as big
as we can but as little as we can. What are we
after? You: what are you after? And I: what
am I after? I say we must step out and around
and over and under and across. We must do all
we can to discredit what holds us down and keeps
us in. It is not life but death for us to shrink
from the alternatives of liberty. I give a free
<a id="page-80" class="pagenum" title="80"></a>
pass to the universe. For day and night. For
always. For the suns and stars to walk in any
time. For the seasons to come and go as they
choose. That is, I declare myself wide open. I
take all the shutters down. I put all the doors
back on their hinges as far as they will go. I
throw all keys away. Then I invite the world in.
I say to the world: Possess yourself of me. I
say to the world: I dont want to deny you
anything. I want the world to take me at my
word. And you, my brother: I want you to take
me at my word. If life is a monastery then I
choose death. If life is asceticism then I choose
death. If life is classes and superiors and owners
then I choose death. If life is a stockade.
If life is the sacrifice of all to a few. If life is
being blind and deaf and dumb. If life is living
back of a high wall. If life is this sort of thing
then I choose death. The path of life is not to
the grave but to the cradle. The signal, the symbol,
of life is not division but unity. What is the
use of living if you cant be alive? Why should
I hide in a hole when I should be a rover? Why
should I keep myself out of the main currents of
experience? Man from the start has been breaking
loose from the drag of the dust. He has
sometimes resorted to violent means to his end.
He has dashed thrones to the earth and killed
tyrants. He has gone to war. He has robbed
his neighbor. He has so far not called his brother
by his right name. He has lived inside himself.
But that&rsquo;s only half a life. You live a whole life
only when you live inside others as well as inside
yourself. But with all his pausings and writhings
<a id="page-81" class="pagenum" title="81"></a>
he has helped himself along towards deliverance.
For there is only one deliverance. The deliverance
of a man to his brother. The unimpeded
approach of one man to another. All time, all
space, are for that. That is what time and space
are. That is what civilization is. Getting acquainted.
That is civilization. Mercilessly wiping
out the last atom between. So that there is
not only nothing to climb over but nothing to
stumble over in passing to and fro. That is what
it was and is and must hereafter all be for. Life.
Art. Everything. It must all be for that. To
get armies and navies and properties from between.
If it was not all for that then it would all
be for nothing. If it left that unachieved then it
would leave life unachieved. If it is right for anything
to remain between then I see no reason why
everything you please should not remain between.
Do you see a door anywhere? Throw it open
wide. Do you see an interfering income or ambition
anywhere? Throw it open wide. I do
not say: Be gentle in doing it. I say: Throw it
open: dont wait a minute: throw it open.
</p>

<p>
To leave no door unopened. Is there any short
cut from a man to himself? Every time you shut
a door you shut it on yourself. When you close
one out you are one time shut in. When you
close the people out you are millions of times shut
in. You cant shut out without shutting in.
Every dollar you lay away against others is laid
away against yourself. The barrier you set up
against the world. It&rsquo;s as hard for you to get
over it as for the world to get over it. It&rsquo;s like
hating somebody. You may do him some harm.
<a id="page-82" class="pagenum" title="82"></a>
But you do yourself worse harm. Your hate
could not stick to him. But it sticks to you. The
hater always wears the scars of hate. You cant
have yourself unless you have others. The penalty
of being exclusive is exclusion. You feed
only one light. If you put that light out for me
you put it out for yourself. I know you think
you can go it alone. But you cant. You may
stand very firm. But you are on the common
ground. There is no other ground. You may
breathe in the air off your housetop. But you
breathe the common air. There is no other air.
Nothing will work if it is set up to separate individuals
or peoples. It may last for awhile. But
it cant be perpetuated. That which is not rooted
in the people cannot survive in the person. You
cant alienate your life. You can kill yourself.
But you cant alienate yourself. You may do it
through an income. You may do it through an
art. You may do it through ambition. It makes
no difference how. But you are from then on
dead. You may still hang around. But you are
dead. For no man can live only in his own few
feet and pounds of mortal flesh. He needs a
world to live in. To live in a world means to
live the life of that world. Not monkeyishly.
Not as a slave. No. But within the horizon of
its ideals and sympathies. Living the world&rsquo;s
life in your own way. Giving the world&rsquo;s life
your identity. But living it. Not trying to
break with it. Not using property or fame or
anything as a pretext for isolation. Our institutions
and systems are arbitrary checks put
upon the spirit. Even seats of learning. Even
<a id="page-83" class="pagenum" title="83"></a>
exhibitions of pictures. The artist is used as a
check upon art. That is, upon life. He is put
in the way instead of leading the way. You cant
steer a world into your back yard. But you can
steer your back yard into a world. You say man
cant live by bread alone. No. He cant. He
must live by love. He cant live in himself alone.
He can only live in the crowd. How can you
pass from yourself to yourself again? With all
the money between. With the power between.
With the pride between. With the ambition between.
How can you? How can you hope to
live a true life in such a false relation? How
can you expect to lead a seeing life in such a blind
contingency? You are all closed out as well as
closed in. It cant matter which side of the door
you are on. It is equally fatal either side of that
door. Worse, if worse either side, on the inside
than the outside. It is better to be closed out
than to close out. It is better to be a pauper outside
than a millionaire inside. I would rather die
in the life of the crowd than live in the death of
myself. You are in on the ground floor. The
ground floor is hell. Dont you feel the flames
lick and bite at you? I cant put anything between
myself and others. It is perfidy. It is as
if I sold the people out. Any personal wish.
Any individual instinct. Anything. Any interrupting
item however innocent is a crime. That
is why our proud profits are ignoble. That is
why the professional successes are cluttering debris.
That is why nothing but absolute abandon
will signify in the last count. We dont want to
be hid away in holes. Our fortunes hide us away
<a id="page-84" class="pagenum" title="84"></a>
in holes. Our eminences hide us away. Getting
ahead of competitors hides us away. I get a
little more money than the next man. Then I
hide away from him. Then I hide him away
from me. A private victory is not integration.
It is dissolution. Social wealth stands for the
open door. Personal acquisition stands for the
frowning wall. I indict the systems because they
drive men apart. Every institution created for a
caste sits with closed doors. It thinks itself the
custodian of a treasure. It is only the trustee of
an assumption. For it always closes out infinitely
more than it closes in. I indict the systems
because they close their creators in. Because
they make themselves useless. Because
they are arrayed against the mob. There&rsquo;s only
one good side to the mob. That&rsquo;s the inside. The
mob. All. There&rsquo;s only one good side to it.
Nothing is so little as a big thing in a jail. Nothing
is so big as a little thing free out of doors.
Our civilization is a big thing. But it&rsquo;s in jail.
We&rsquo;ve got to get it out of doors. That is, you&rsquo;ve
put our civilization in vaults and used it for the
few against the crowd. We&rsquo;ve got to level the
vaults. We&rsquo;ve got to get our civilization out of
doors. We&rsquo;ve got to hand it around. Open all
the doors. Let everybody in. Yes, even the derelicts.
Hand civilization around. Let everybody
help himself. That&rsquo;s crazy? So it is. But nothing
in this world ever got its growth till it was
crazy. No man ever did anything to push things
along beyond till he began to be called a fool and
a suspect and was avoided by his friends. Throw
everything wide open. Dont worry about the
<a id="page-85" class="pagenum" title="85"></a>
weather. The weather with love in it wont hurt
whatever it is. Your job, my job, is this: To
leave no door unopened.
</p>

<p>
To leave no door unopened. Do you know
what that means? It means to leave no heart
unopened. To leave no income unopened. To
leave no book or picture or song unopened. It
is a challenge. You are to trust yourself to love
not to a lock. You are to trust yourself to people
not to yourself. You are to trust yourself to the
whole not to a part. You will no longer trust
yourself to your dollars. You will no longer
fasten yourself in. You will no longer worry
to-night wondering about to-morrow morning or
worry to-morrow morning wondering about sundown.
You have great evidences. The vast
properties. The cities and the farms. The railroads
and the telegraphs. The sure and the counterfeit.
They are immense. They cant be counted
up. But there are better evidences. You dont
quote them. You sneer at them or you pass them
by. The people. They are better evidences.
The love of the people. The idealism of the
people. The revolt of the people. They are
better evidences. After all your buildings are
set on the ground. Your riches are hidden dead
in vaults. But the people are vital and flowing.
People make houses. But have houses ever made
people? I have seen houses so large they became
aware of their littleness. I have seen people so
modest they became aware of their immeasurability.
We have made our towns ruthless. They
are not fit to live in. We expect people to live in
them without love. We can live nowhere without
<a id="page-86" class="pagenum" title="86"></a>
love. It may be necessary to sweep half our world
away in the interest of the other half. It may be
necessary to stampede all values. To abrogate
all treaties. To repeal all laws. To annul all
respectabilities. All in the interest of life. We
have to open all doors. No plea can resist this
purpose. As sure as the sun comes up this will
come up. You have planned your world. But
you have left love out. You want everything
protected. Especially property. Property. I
say take all your protectives off property. I say
put all your protectives on people. If no one
owns no one will steal. If all own all will be fed.
Every time you write a deed a door is closed.
Every time you repudiate possession a door is
opened. If you take down your shutters you
will find it is day. Matters have gone on farther
than you suppose. Farther towards love. Give
them a show. Forget that you are a proprietor
and remember that you are a man. Forget that
you own anything and remember that you are
something. I dont advise you to destroy your
properties. I only say: Take your name off
them. How much better it looks not to be a
boss or a superior. How much more like opening
doors. How much more like fraternity. We
cant have a world of brothers as long as any door
is closed any where against any body. Nor while
any piece of land or goods or any power of man&rsquo;s
arms or brains is closed against any body. This
has got to be made a wide open world. I dont
care where profits go. Nor where privileges.
Nor what becomes of the elect. Nor whether
anyone ever paints a picture again or preaches of
<a id="page-87" class="pagenum" title="87"></a>
beauty. I dont care. I am first of all interested
in men and women. I want to know first of all
what becomes of men and women. If men and
women get what belongs to them the graces will
take care of themselves. But if the ornaments
are put first then they are discredited and must
be dethroned. What we will do with the esthetic
will depend first and last of all upon what we do
with men and women. I want every door opened
as far as it will go. And every heart. And every
fortune. And every opportunity. And every
vista. I dont want anybody standing anywhere
asking anyone: Where&rsquo;s your ticket? As if the
sun before shining should ask: Where&rsquo;s your
ticket? Or the air we breathe: Where&rsquo;s your
ticket? All have made what the few have. Yet
the few ask: Where&rsquo;s your ticket? As if love
should ask: Where&rsquo;s your ticket? There is no
ticket. There is the open way. There is no
ticket. There is the eager willing impulse. There
is no ticket. There is the unhesitating sacrifice
and consecration. There is no ticket. There are
only fields on which we share the harvest. There
is no ticket. There is the commune. There is no
ticket. There are only people. When you push
through no one asks: Where are you going?
Everybody says: Walk right in. When you
look for what you want no one asks: Will you
pay cash down for it or shall I charge it? Everyone
says: Help yourself. You say: People never
will work in your world. I say: People who get
too little so hard will not stop work because they
are to get enough so easy. Everywhere we go
now everything is closed and everybody is asked:
<a id="page-88" class="pagenum" title="88"></a>
Where&rsquo;s your ticket? Everywhere we go then
everything will be wide open and everybody will
be told: Make yourself at home. We are to
continue on and on till the last outcast becomes
the first citizen. Till this generation of exiles
becomes the next generation of comrades. To
leave no door unopened.

HAVE YOU SOLD YOUR SOUL?
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">H</span><span class="postfirstchar">ave</span> you sold your soul for dirt? And what
have you sold your body for? Have you given
away what you are for what you can get? Have
you traded off your body for your soul or your
soul for your body? Or have you gone on taking
both with you on equal terms? You may think
you have profited when you have lost. You may
believe you are a victor when you are defeated. I
have no quarrel with the earth. But dirt can
never take the place of a man. Nor can a man&rsquo;s
living ever take the place of a man&rsquo;s life. What
a man does may be successful. And what a man
is may be a failure. Any one thing in the place
of any other thing is a failure. If we want a man
goods wont do. If we want love money wont
do. If we want faith comfort wont do. If we
want beauty falsehood wont do. You are all
talking about making your way. Making your
way to what? It all depends on that. To what?
A man may make his way. He may cut a tremendous
figure. He may outpace everyone and
invite envy and admiration. He may do all that
and still be dead. And then he may do all that
is the opposite of that. He may be the most lamented
man in his crowd. He may do and be
all that and still be alive. It&rsquo;s always harder to
know what to do with too much than with too
little. I readily get used to reverses. But I can
never quite accommodate myself to a triumph.
When things go against me I always have myself
left in my own favor. But when things go for
<a id="page-91" class="pagenum" title="91"></a>
me I always have myself asking me questions I
cant answer. My body and my soul are imperative.
I cant make light of their demands.
Let me sell them out: then what happens? Dirt
begets dirt. Reach outside yourself for something
that is only to be found inside yourself:
then what happens? Every grain of sand that
gets where it dont belong interrupts the revolution
of the planets. Down the sunbeam dances
the anarchic atom. Have you sold your soul for
dirt? Sold your soul for something not itself?
Sold your soul to the alien? I do not accuse you.
I ask you a question. I do not say you do wrong.
I ask you why you do not do right. I do not say
you are outside the fold. I invite you inside the
fold. I have no wish to make you a good man or
a bad man. I want you to come into what
you were born for. I want you to step out of the
way of the universe and to step into the way of
yourself. Do not confuse my values. I am no
despiser of the body. I am no enemy of markets.
You may sell your soul for dirt. Sell sermons as
easily as sell goods. I see the best in the house of
Man and the worst in the house of God. I do not
charge. I persuade. I build no fires to burn anybody
up. I only build fires to light the way.
Have you betrayed yourself with thirty pieces of
silver? Have you sold yourself? Have you permitted
yourself to be sold? Are you exposed for
sale on the bargain counters? You are consigned
to yourself in trust. Have you betrayed
your trust? The world is consigned to itself in
trust. Has it betrayed its trust? Have you sold
your soul for dirt? You may have bought souls.
<a id="page-92" class="pagenum" title="92"></a>
That means that you have sold your soul for dirt.
You have no right to buy or sell. As long as
buying and selling lasts you cant help selling
your soul for dirt. Nothing can purify the way
as long as one man exacts toll of another man.
Everything should be everywhere. Everybody
should help himself. We live in the age of bought
and sold. We are about to pass into the age of
help yourself. I ask you who walk the streets:
Have you sold your soul for dirt? I ask the
world of all which includes the world of one:
Have you sold your soul for dirt? Have you sold
your soul for manners, forms, titles, incomes,
prestige, position? for anything you put into
your belly or on your back? for anything which
makes you superior to anybody else? for anything
which puts the way you do a thing above what
you are doing? for anything in laws or economics
or books or arts which serves as a weapon with
which to club the innocent? for anything over
ground or under, any sneaking device of profit,
which subjects others to your advancement?
Have you sold your soul for dirt?
</p>

<p>
You have sold your soul for dirt. You have
conformed. You have said one and two make
four after all the rest. You suspected that one
and two make three. But you did not like to
say so. You have obeyed the thing around you
rather than the thing in you. Votes, interests,
profits, privileges, stand for you in place of the
soul. You surrender to a job. You are enslaved
to something that was made yesterday. You
have sold your soul for dirt. You can only buy it
back with soul. The time will come when we will
<a id="page-93" class="pagenum" title="93"></a>
sell our dirt for soul. I know what it means to
try that now. It means poverty and banishment.
The devil take the hindmost, they say. The devil
will. Or the god will. When you see all the poor.
When you see all those who rob and are robbed.
When you see the devastation the profit system
leaves in its wake. When you see all the confusions
of sex. When you see prostitution. Then
you know that something has been sold for dirt.
What has been sold. Our civilization. You and
I. The man you sell has not been sold. The
man who sells has been sold. The victim of per
cents has not been sold. The victor has been
sold. The hand that draws the knife is the murdered
as well as the murderer. Your genius may
be your dirt. The thing you do best. The possession
you are most proud of. The public applause.
Your friends. Your family. Your heredity.
They may be your dirt. Even if you sell yourself
for your best loved you sell yourself for
dirt. Love can do no harm. But lovers may sell
love for dirt. Anything that&rsquo;s in the way of
the spirit is dirt. You make goods. But if your
goods are slave goods they are dirt. You have
no right to make your talent a club with which to
batter down the inefficient. You say every man
should be paid according to his talent. I say
that&rsquo;s exactly what they should not be paid according
to. A man&rsquo;s talent may be his best weapon
of injustice. Talent is the coward&rsquo;s weapon.
You may be born a king. You may be born a
genius. It&rsquo;s as bad to use a crown of brains as
to use a crown of gold to exploit the humble.
Using what you were born with to such an end
<a id="page-94" class="pagenum" title="94"></a>
is the final cowardice. We use laws. We use
forms. We use social position. Anything within
reach. It&rsquo;s the blow in the dark. It&rsquo;s the lie
on the lip. It&rsquo;s the giant taking advantage of
the pigmy. You see a little farther. That is
your dirt. Your arm is a little longer. You hear
a little more. You move a little quicker. That
is your dirt. All the inequities come by such a
route. All the gloating palaces and the snarling
huts. All the laughing luxuries and the weeping
wants. They come by that route. My best
suit of clothes. It comes that way. Less and
more comes by that process. Do you pride yourself
on your faculty? Rather do anything else.
Even your faculty may be a tyrant toll-gatherer.
Down every mountain steep tumble your horrified
inferiors. Time and space recognize no
large and small, no above and below, no served
and servant. A man has a little better or a
little worse thinking machine. But better or
worse are not to time and space what they are
to words. Evil begins when man begins. Tyranny
begins when one man has more heartbeats
than another man. When dirt gets on top.
Brains are a whip. You use that whip over
others. You make that whip into statutes, mandates,
wage-scales. You make everything else
second to it. You may have got so far that you
are horrified when a man makes a dollar an
agent of oppression. You have still to go on till
you are horrified when a man makes his talent an
agent of oppression. The king sits on a throne.
The picture hangs in the gallery. The book is
on the shelf of the library. The music is sung
<a id="page-95" class="pagenum" title="95"></a>
in the great hall. The play goes on in the theater.
The game is won or lost in the vast stadium.
Do they circumscribe us? Or do they
free us? Are they burdens to carry? Or are
they wings to fly with? Are they for the pleasure
of a few? Or are they for the joy of all?
Money may free. Brains may enslave. Money
may be the gentle savior. Brains may be the
brutal damner of bodies and souls. You have
sold your soul for dirt if you have used it for
the production of anything but soul. Whether in
the market or in the academy. Whether in play
or work. Whether in the midst of your family
or abroad in the crowd. You have sold your soul
for dirt. Whether in making money or staying
poor. Whether in the most exquisite beauty of
an art or the most hideous ugliness of a brothel.
You have sold your soul for dirt. Babies at the
breasts of mothers are sold for dirt. Fathers
who have cared for children are sold for dirt.
Poems, laces, anything, may be sold for dirt.
Anything that gets in the way of life. That is
sold for dirt. Religion, churches, policies of
states and industries, are sold for dirt. Sex.
Idealism. The marriage bed. Dreams. They
are sold for dirt. Souls are the dearest things
in a cheap world. The house you live in. The
cup of water you hand to the famished. Benefaction.
Hospitals for disease. The very kindnesses
of social rectitude. The excuse-mes and
thank-yous of the polite and the amiable. The
bowings and scrapings of parlors. They are sold
for dirt. Nothing can pay for souls but souls.
But you take dirt in pay for souls. Every time
<a id="page-96" class="pagenum" title="96"></a>
you get in the way of life you accept dirt as a
settlement for souls. The nights of dalliance.
The hours of love. The perfumed bower. The
groves of arcadian ecstasy. They are sold for
dirt. All. All. You have sold your soul for
dirt.
</p>

<p>
Have you sold your soul for dirt? Have you
given up that which is priceless for a price?
Have you ripped off your wings and asked:
What&rsquo;s the use of flying? Have you postponed
next year? Have you said: I&rsquo;d like to be myself
but cant? Or have you said: It&rsquo;s all very well to
talk? Have you always been putting yourself off?
Saying: To-morrow will do for me? That to-morrow
after all the to-morrows that never
comes? Have you planned to sell your body for
fifty years and then live beyond bargain and sale?
Or your soul? The cry comes to you out of your
own deeps. It wears no disguise. It&rsquo;s you yourself
asking questions of yourself. Have you sold
your soul for dirt? In every act of injustice you
sell yourself. When you turn your back on some
body. When you steal a man&rsquo;s wages and call it
profit. When you make it harder for some one
to live in order to make it easier for yourself to
live. When you call white black and up down.
When you become respectable at some one else&rsquo;s
expense. When you put the show of good manners
above the fact of bad heart. Then you have
sold yourself for dirt. When you corner anything.
Even virtue. When you corner pictures
or books or curios. When you corner ideas.
When you jealously corner your dreams. When
you eat too much while others eat too little.
<a id="page-97" class="pagenum" title="97"></a>
When you dedicate any of the sources of life
to anything but the common privilege. Then
you have sold your soul for dirt. If your love
stops with your family. If you can love your
own children and not love the children of others.
If you hog anything in flesh or spirit. You have
sold your soul for dirt. You have called upon all
men to listen. You are for sale. Come here.
Listen. Here&rsquo;s a man for sale. What will you
give for him? He is for sale cheap. For he can
be paid for in the basest coin. He can be bought
for the dirt under your bootsole. You can buy
him for a house or bonds or goods in a store or
things made in a factory. You can buy him for a
crop off a farm. You can buy him for the clothes
he wears and the food he puts into his belly. He
ought to be dear beyond anyone&rsquo;s ability to buy
him. But almost anybody can buy him. He puts
such a mean price on himself. He will bargain
himself off for almost anything that will furnish
his keep. Have you met that man? Do you
know his name? Can you give me his initials?
Does he live round the corner? Or maybe in
your own house? Or do you wake up nights
and say to yourself: He&rsquo;s in this bed? Maybe
you tell me he&rsquo;s as good as he can be under the
circumstances. I dont see why any man should
expect to be a man under the circumstances.
Light is not darkness under the circumstances.
Death is not life under the circumstances. Right
is not wrong under the circumstances. Every
man has to adjust the circumstances to himself.
Dont tell me a man always has to adjust himself
to the circumstances. A man&rsquo;s circumstance
<a id="page-98" class="pagenum" title="98"></a>
is his dirt. I am too familiar with your underlying
assets to assent to this overlying result. Do
I expect you to fight? Am I asking too much?
Yes, fight. No: I am only asking enough. I see
nothing preposterous in asking a man to be what
he is. In asking beauty to be beautiful. In asking
a song to sing. In asking gentleness to be
gentle. In asking generosity to give. In asking
the cloud to rain. In asking water to run down
hill. In asking the fulfilment of life. What do
I ask you for? For the fulfilment of life&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all. I decline to call your wars and your exploitations
and your greeds the fulfilment of life.
They are rather the fulfilment of death. I decline
to call the barbarism we call civilization the fulfilment
of life. I decline to call the love we call
marriage the fulfilment of life. I decline to call
the pride we call art. Or the austerity we call
science. Or the hypocrisy we call religion. I
decline to call them the fulfilment of life. They
are the fulfilment of death. I decline to call the
hells the fulfilment of life. The hells of theology.
The hells of profit and loss. The hells of owners
and owned. The hells of poor and rich. The
hells of those who have everything and those who
have nothing. The hells of those who make everything
the writ of the tax gatherer. I decline to
call them the fulfilment of life. They are the
fulfilment of death. I acknowledge your institutions.
I do not dismiss property. I put dreams
and people above all the lauded majesty of learning
and possessions. No man is so little but his
head is higher than your Oxfords and Harvards.
No man is so degraded but he outshines the luster
<a id="page-99" class="pagenum" title="99"></a>
of bonds and trade. You say a man must make
a living. I say no. That is already made for
him here or somewhere. What a man must make
is life. To make a living leaves us dirt still. To
make life gives us wings. We want everybody
to get out of the way of life. The world. The
crowd. You. I. We must get out of the way
of life. If the superman gets in the way of the
underman he is in the way of life. He has sold
his soul for dirt. Would I destroy civilization?
Yes&mdash;if I could help civilization by doing so.
Have you sold your soul for dirt? Have you
traded down instead of up? I am pulling down
the monuments. The great men. The masters.
The leaders and superiors. The geniuses and the
marvels. I shake them down in a common ruin.
In order to rebuild greatness. In order to bring
out of all what so far has been all brought out
of some. I turn all values upside down. I turn
all ideals and instrumentalities upside down.
In order that man may come up. Now man is
below all the rest. Then all the rest will be
below man. Now the soul is the means and what
it produces the end. Then what is produced will
be the means. The soul will be the end. I would
demolish everything if necessary to save everything.
Have you sold your soul for dirt?

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">hen</span> I look into the faces of men and women.
When I go to men and women without distrust.
When I put men and women before goods. When
I even put them before their passions. Even put
them before their parts. The whole before its
parts. When I do this I find myself somehow at
once in touch with men and women. I no longer
make too much or too little of their good and bad.
I no longer pause with ephemeral details. I no
longer miss seeing man in observing men. I
no longer go grieved to my work. My feet are
lighter. My heart is gay. My brain is cleared
from all eclipses. My dreams become possible.
My insanest rhapsodies are understood. To go
among men and women as one of them instead of
above or below them. To know people for comrades.
To see no one so mean he could not be a
brother. To see no one so great he could withdraw
from communion. To fraternize on an
equality without question with the crowd. To
ask no questions. To go without question. To
pass among men and women for one who loves.
Throwing off all veils. Going without disguises.
Without disguises of virtue as well as disguises
of clothes. To meet their suspicion with faith.
Not to be turned against men by the injustice of
men. Here I stand. No man triumphs in being
loved. We only triumph in loving. Nor in being
believed in. We only triumph in believing.
And if I acquiesce in men and women I will acquiesce
in them even in the face of truth. I will
<a id="page-102" class="pagenum" title="102"></a>
say yes when you accuse them but I will continue
to love them. I will not deny the facts. But I
will live above the facts. I will not say there is
no dirt. But I will say there is more than dirt.
I do not need figures for my affirmation. I only
need men and women. Clean and corrupt men
and women. Strong and frail men and women.
I know all that is said about the evasions of human
nature. And I acknowledge the defaults of
human nature. It makes its fathomless descents.
But I see no fall from which it cant lift itself victoriously.
I am not afraid of the impenetrable
nights. For there was daylight before and there
will be daylight again and the darkness itself is
created by a sunbeam. When I look at a man
and a woman I see what is back of them and I
see what is ahead. I am not thrown off the scent
of glory by the trail of a serpent. I am not worried
by the treacheries of the flesh. I do not
spend time trying to disprove the shadows. I
only insist upon the light. I am always aware of
the crowd. I am aware of one only because I
am aware of all. I always come back to myself
enriched. If I feel out of touch with myself I
get in touch with the crowd. That keys me right
again. The harmonies are restored. The men
and women on the streets. They do not even
look at me. Yet I am full of them and they are
full of me. They are not aunts and uncles and
cousins and fathers and mothers. They are the
godstuff out of which the death and resurrection
of the stars is effected. They are unmakers and
makers. They are the divined and they are diviners.
If I know men and women I do not
<a id="page-103" class="pagenum" title="103"></a>
need gods. If I know gods I do need men and
women. I say to every man or woman I pass:
You are my other self. For I know that nothing
could tear us apart. I know that you can no
more separate men from each other, or women, or
women from men, than you can take an atom off
the crust of the earth and toss it into nothingness.
And so I love to go among men and women.
Love to throw myself upon the convincing
mercies of my anonymous pilgrimage. Choosing
not to figure up my totals in so many enemies and
so many friends but in so many brothers. In the
last calculations refusing to calculate. Casting
myself into the sea and taking my chances. Into
the seething whirling surging reluctant hospitable
mass. Preferring sin with all than virtue
alone. Not always being pleased but always being
loyal. Sure in the end that I could go nowhere
ruling others out of heaven. Sure in the
end that I am entitled to nothing which the
crowd does not confer. So that when I meet you
whoever you are I take off my hat to you. Loving
you is a way I have of thanking myself that you
exist. Trusting you is a way I have of congratulating
myself upon your inheritance. For we
are joint heirs, all of us, or there is no heir. And
we are joint villains or there is no villain. And
joint saviors and gods or there are no saviors and
gods. All of us. Men and women. All of us.
Though we dont see each other, joint for saved
or damned anyway. I am closer to everybody
than anybody thinks. And everybody is closer to
me. And though we may appear to be nonchalant
and unconcerned about each other the bond is
<a id="page-104" class="pagenum" title="104"></a>
still unseverable. There is nothing anyone can
do to cut him off from me. And nothing I can
do to rid the crowd of its responsibility. I look
curiously at you as you pass. You are not beautiful
or ugly to me. You are not rich or poor or
well-dressed or in rags. You are my brothers.
When I look into the faces of saints and scoundrels
I see only men and women. Always. Always.
And when I look into the faces of men
and women I see only gods and their companion
gods. Always. Always.
</p>

<p>
When I look into the faces of men and women.
When I see what they might do and dont do.
When I see their hypocrisies and degeneracies.
When I see how far down they go after what is
not worth going for at all. When I see that they
walk in darkness when they could as easily walk
in light. When I see their brutal warfares and
their corrupting commerces and their wit-proud
arts. Then I wonder. Then my wonder is multiplied
by wonder and is dismayed. Then things
crowd and choke my spirit. Then I see what
the despairers mean when they say man is not
worth his flesh. Then I am like someone thrown
into a threatening sea. Then I cry for help. The
stars pale and disappear. The compass no longer
points north. Love becomes only another word
for hate. Working seems as useless as loafing.
When I see the crowd robbed and awed by the
few. When I see the few robbed and awed by
the crowd. When I see nothing fitting with
nothing the world over. Trade not fitting with
justice. Art not fitting with life. No one man
fitting with another man. No man fitting with
<a id="page-105" class="pagenum" title="105"></a>
the crowd and the crowd fitting with no man.
Your to-day and my to-day not fitting with our
yesterdays or our to-morrows. This life not fitting
with any life that has been or is to be. Children
not fitting with parents and parents not fitting
with children. Bodies not fitting with souls
and souls not fitting with bodies. What we do
not fitting with what we wish to do. Ambition
not fitting with performance. Lovers not fitting
with loving. Wives not fitting with husbands.
Everywhere, everywhere, the inglorious travesty.
Our religions not fitting with the gods. Our
states not fitting with the people. The mortal
moment not fitting with immortal time. Things,
souls, tendencies, distraught. When I see that
I too withdraw and make less of life. I too retire
from my proud boast. I too humble myself
before the shaming fact. I too confess my sins.
I too charge a big bill up against my ardent
faith. I too feel myself enclosed by falsifying
conclusions. I too measure myself and weigh
myself by what is trivial and puny. I too walk
around less sure of myself. Yes, less sure of you.
Less sure of all. Less sure of my dreams. Less
sure of the very feet I walk on and the very wings
by which I soar. Less sure of the picture you
paint. Less sure of the song you sing. Less sure
of my own passionate words of encouragement
and revelation. Less sure. Less sure. Not giving
up the great hope. But less sure. Not giving
up the food I eat but less sure that it feeds
me. Not giving up my certainties but less sure
that they are certain. Not breaking finally with
you O love but less sure that even you O love
<a id="page-106" class="pagenum" title="106"></a>
are quite so potent as I have thought. Not turning
my back on my darling comrades the crowd
but not as sure as I have been that my smiling
face conveys any message to them. When I see
that men cant live with each other without hate.
That they cant trade with each other without
robbery. That they cant grow big with power
without growing little with pride. That they are
not satisfied with self rule. That they must rule
each other. When I see that men would rather
be prosperous and have all poor than be poor and
have all prosperous. Then I am lost. Then I am
lost. I do not know my way. The sun goes out.
My heart goes out. All the beautiful results I
was so confident of go out. Love goes out. O,
love goes out. Holy final love: it, too, goes out.
Goes out like an unreturning tide. I am left alone.
Left trying to touch something I can hold on to.
Something left of all the wreckage which I can
hold on to. Some remnant of joy. Some glint
of vision. Some splinter. Some saving strand.
Reaching for some hand to lift me above the
whirling maddened departing stream. When I
see man going back on man. When I see goods
and incomes and rulership going back on man it
means nothing to me. But when I see man going
back on man it means all to me. Then I am
prostrate. Then my voice is stopped. I can say
nothing. I drift. God knows where to. I drift.
It dont seem as if anything was left to do. As
if the fight was worth keeping up. As if being
loyal was more important than being traitorous.
When man goes back on man. I who was so
<a id="page-107" class="pagenum" title="107"></a>
unshakably sure. I who now am shaken. When
man goes back on man.
</p>

<p>
When I look into the faces of men and women.
After the eclipses and the disfigurements. After
the enmities and the degradations. After going
into all the hells. After making all the admissions.
After being swept away in the rages of
the tyrant passions. Then suddenly the shining
sun breaks through. Then suddenly the earth is
flooded with light. Then I am restored. I who
was cast down am lifted up. I who wondered so
much over the weakness of men and women wonder
now over the irresistible strength of men and
women. Then things are explained. Then evil
is explained in the good. Hate is explained in
love. That which men and women did not do
is explained in what they are capable of doing.
Grief is explained in rapture. The greeds are
explained in generosity. For I see at last that
a man and a woman are not explained in what
they do but in what they lead to. What a man
and woman do is too often ghastly. But somehow
what they lead to is always beautiful. I had
looked into the faces of men and women and it
was night there. Now the sun is up. Now the
faces are radiant. I know that when a man and a
woman rob or hate night is there. And I know
that when they serve and love the day has come.
And I know that a man and a woman containing
love and justice will someway through whatever
contagions of animosity and crime become loving
and just. I go about in this midday of the spirit.
In the streets. Everywhere. Where men and
women are. And I see men and women as they
<a id="page-108" class="pagenum" title="108"></a>
do not see themselves. I tell them things they
do not tell themselves. I lift them up to planes to
which they do not lift themselves. For the sun
is up in my world. And when the sun is up in
the world the world is flushed with insight. When
the sun is up in your world you too will know.
But until then you will doubt or deny. When
the sun is up in the world there is light enough
to go round. Light enough to account for all the
darkness. Good enough to account for all the
evil. Sweet enough to account for all the sour.
Life enough to account for all the death. Now
the sun is up in my world. And as you pass before
me, as I loaf about among you, unrecognized,
you men and women, you are as plain to me as
my own thumb. I dont need to argue with myself
about you. For there&rsquo;s infinite light in my
world. Light to penetrate you through and
through. Light to challenge all hideousness and
to disperse all contaminations. If I did not think
better of you, men and women, than you do of
yourselves, I would give you up, O men and women.
But my world accounts for you. Accounts
for the beast in you by the man in you. Accounts
for your moral surrenders by your spiritual victories.
If my world did not light you enough to
light you to justice and joy then my light might
as well be darkness. If it did not light the crowd
enough to light it to the man or light the man
enough to light him to the crowd it might as well
be darkness. If it did not light the effaced scholars
enough to light them to life again it might as
well be darkness. If it did not throw itself full
into your faces, O men and women, and disclose
<a id="page-109" class="pagenum" title="109"></a>
you to yourselves, and disclose love to itself, and
disclose the vast peoples to themselves, and disclose
all the mistakes to themselves, and disclose
all the dividing creeds and industries to themselves:
oh! if my light did not disclose everything
to itself so that it might light everything
farther to its ineffable consequence, then it might
as well be darkness. O, it might as well be darkness.
But my light is competent. It is enough
for everywhere and enough for all. It lights
everything to itself. It lights the man to the
woman and the woman to the man and the few
to many and many to all and all to the one again.
My light might as well be darkness if it fails to
light everything to itself and all to everything in
the storm and calm of its masterful plenty. When
I look into the faces of men and women.

Do you know what it means to say love? to be always and
only saying love every day every where?
</p>

<p>
You think it&rsquo;s easy to say love but hard to say hate: I say
no: love is hardest of all to say:
</p>

<p>
For sometimes you must say love with a knife: sometimes
with the cruelest word you know:
</p>

<p>
Saying love is not saying soft things sweetly to make your
lover comfortable: far from that:
</p>

<p>
Saying love is often to say things that cut and rend: things
that may even destroy: do you hear?

LOVING IS THE ONLY LIFE
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">L</span><span class="postfirstchar">oving</span> is the only life. Living must give us
time for life. It is not enough to fill your lungs
with air. You must fill your lungs with life.
The heart must not only beat. It must beat the
dance of life. It is not important to live so many
years. It is important to live so much life. You
have dollars. But have you life? You write
something. People admire you. You are famous
for some reason or other. That is all very
great. But there is something beyond. Life is
beyond. Eating and sleeping is not life. Love
alone is life. You are brilliant. You perform
in the center of the stage. But that is not life.
Lending money at percents. Making profits.
Getting a house full of decorations. That is not
life. A man may have all that and more and be
stone dead. I pass you on the street. You look
empty. You are hungry. You ache and strain
for something. What is it you yet need? You
who have so much. You who seem to have all
the world. You to whose door all ships seem to
sail and into whose treasury all cargoes seem to
be unloaded. You cast upon me such a vacant
look. You have not found out that your wealth
is not life. You have not consciously said that
to yourself. But your body has found it out.
Your soul has found it out. You have power.
You can draw a big check. You are admitted
anywhere. You are welcome to interrupt the
world at its devotions. Nobody would think of
closing you out. The state, the church, open
<a id="page-112" class="pagenum" title="112"></a>
when you appear, before you say a word. Yet
you cast that empty look upon me when we pass.
That telltale look. That look that means more
than your riches. That look of infinite self pity.
You have the key to all locks. But you are helpless
before that which having no lock needs no
key. You are alive. But you do not possess life.
You are your own master. But that is not
enough. There is something beyond. After being
your own master you must know how to become
your own slave. You can live in the senses.
In the gratification of the passions. In the accumulation
of temporal properties. But living is
not life. So many in so many generations have
been fooled. They have got what they reached
for. But they have found that what they reached
for was not what they desired. When a man is
greedy. When he seems willing to do anything
to get goods. Then life seems to say to him:
Here&rsquo;s what you want: now what are you going
to do with it? You are filled to the brim. What
are you going to do with it? You run over with
success. What are you going to do with it? You
are known everywhere you go. The instant your
name is mentioned everybody knows who you are.
What are you going to do with it? This is living.
But this is not life. You are a conqueror. You
are a maker of laws. You rule people. What you
say goes. Those who hate fear you. Those who
love despise you. You are an arrogant force upon
whose will for fair or foul the formal living of the
world depends. You have reached deepest into
the dirt. You have reached highest into the blue
ether. Yet you look at me as if you who seem
<a id="page-113" class="pagenum" title="113"></a>
to have all after all have nothing. You have not
discovered that living is not life. You have not
seen that far. But you have discovered that something
is the matter with you. That something is
the matter with the crown you wear. That a diadem
does not make a king. That living does not
make life. That sometimes the more a man contains
the less he contains. That somehow one
dream is worth a thousand facts. That one cipher
is worth more than a thousand figures one. A man
may find that out too late. He often leaves it
to his children to find it out for him. And a
race often finds it out too late. A dazzling generation
of strutters and pirates finds it out too
late. It often leaves it to posterity to find it out.
That&rsquo;s where you are and I am to-day. We have
done wonders. But we have not done enough.
We have still to find ourselves out. We have done
wonders. You and I. Our countries. Your
country. Germany, England, Canada, America.
Our countries. Any countries. They have still
to find themselves out. To find out that living is
not life. To find out that the church and the
state are not life. That priesthoods and plutocracies
are not life. That love alone is life.
That love which means brotherhood all around
and justice going with it all around. That that
love alone is life. That is why our civilization
bulging at the belt is still so empty. That is why
our governments bragging so vastly about their
omnipotence are still so helpless that they can
only maintain themselves with armies and navies.
Like our systems. Which can only maintain
themselves by robbery. They have found
<a id="page-114" class="pagenum" title="114"></a>
much. But they have not found out themselves.
They know how to live. But they have not found
life. For life is only found with love. The way
of life is the way of love. Not the way of living
but the way of life. Not the way of living, which
is bound to come to an end, but the way of life,
which is necessarily interminable. That way of
life which is the way of love.
</p>

<p>
Loving is the only life. But we are warned.
Too much love may mean too little life. Putting
love in place of power may be like putting disease
in place of health. Love. But dont love too
much. Put a little love into trade. But keep
lots of cruelty there to balance it. Be decent.
But dont be too decent. Always keep some villainy
in reserve. Dont rob too much. But still
rob enough to keep the world indignant. If we
had no victims we would have nobody to get mad
at the victors. If we had no bad the good would
be too easy. If a man was not obliged to fight
for his life his death would be painless. There
must be some poison in every dish. There must
be some alloy in every deed. If we all loved
hate would possess us. We need hate to keep
love straight. We need treason to balance loyalty.
You must be very careful so as not to be
too considerate. You must spice your generosity.
Put some greed into it. Make the smooth rough.
Add some bitter to the sweet. A world of love
would lack contrast. Would be without color.
We need the persecutor. Men would go soft
without the tyrant. The bully will qualify the
man. So you need not be so conscience stricken
when you have done some mean thing. But for
<a id="page-115" class="pagenum" title="115"></a>
that mean thing the stars might fall out of their
places. Think of it. Your arm is omnipotence.
Your crime is salvation. You starve the widow
and the orphan. Too much love would make
love itself monotonous. Therefore, corner wheat.
Therefore, collect your rents. Therefore, live on
money someone else has to work for. Therefore,
rejoice in the purchased judgments of courts.
Therefore, shine. No matter whom you obscure,
shine. Get what you can in any way you can get
it. We could not live in a heaven. Mix some
hell with every heaven. Heaven is saved by the
hell in it. Does the idea of love make you shudder?
I am accused of an iniquity. My love notion
is a fallacy. It will take all the flush out of
the cheeks of the world. It will leave us without
a cause. When a man achieves love that is the
end of him. There is no beyond. So with the
social body. When it has achieved love it is dead.
There is nothing to continue with. Motive is
killed. Impetus is gone. After we have accomplished
love we have no reason for being. All
having been done there is nothing to do. The
perfect state will have to react towards imperfection.
Love must pray to be saved from love.
They say to me: You are dragging your earth
the way of death. I am charged with preaching
love at the expense of life. Life could not stand
love. It would break down under the strain. It
would cease, vanish, lapse away. Love requires
its foil. My world, my love&rsquo;s paradise, my fool
eden, without its adams and eves and apples
and temptations, would blast all harvests and reduce
the fertilities of contrast to desert sand.
<a id="page-116" class="pagenum" title="116"></a>
They say to me: Keep your hands off. Let the
wrongs alone. Let the people suffer. Let the
shadows thicken. I say: Loving is the only life.
But you object. Institutions object. The church
objects. The state. The piracies. They all object.
They say: Loving is the only death. Love
and you will live. That is what I have said. Love
and you will die. That is what you have said.
What you say. Love will produce a race of
weaklings. Lovers cant fight. Lovers cant resist.
Lovers cant say no. Lovers can only surrender.
Therefore, your percents are the guarantee
of life. Therefore, your injustices are what
save society from disintegration. Hating is the
spice of life. I have said: Rather go without life
than go without love. You say: Love is only
the fringe of the garment: we must have life.
That is, we must have life no matter what becomes
of love. I say: We must have love whatever
becomes of life. You dissent. Love only
leads life into a pit. Love will not do for every
day. It must have its seasons. It must be reserved
for special occasions. A little love will
keep. Much love will destroy. That is why our
systems are built on cruelties. Their barbarisms
are preservative. Rein your love in. Love will
take all the virility out of the social order. If
you are a lover, go slow. If you wish the race
well, take a second guess. It may be wiser to
wish it ill. You say: Every thing must be done to
preserve the race. I say: Only one kind of a race
is worth preserving. I hear it said that a race of
lovers is as dangerous as a race of haters. I say:
There is a love beyond both love and hate.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-117" class="pagenum" title="117"></a>
Loving is the only life. Love closes no doors.
It throws everything wide open. Houses and
hearts. We go from love to more love. To say
love is to say no more than that things get along
together. To look at the stars and say love is only
to say that the stars obey the law of life. To look
at the body of a woman as a man and say love is
only to say that the flesh obeys the law of life.
To look at a dream. To write a poem. To make a
shoe. To build a bridge. To walk out in the fresh
air. To defy tyrants. To do such things and to
say love is only to say that whatever we do we
obey the law of life. This does not mean always
giving up. It means never giving up. It does
not mean making concessions. It means demanding
concessions. Love is not less rigorous. Love
is more rigorous. Love does not stop half way up.
It goes to the top. And it finds that every top
has another top. And so love never is satisfied
with what it has done. It always finds something
else to do. To look at the bud and say love is
only to prophecy the flower. To look at the wave
and say love is only to call attention to the sea.
To laugh in cloudy weather and say love is only
another verification of the sun. To face the people
who think they are your enemies and say love
is only to make it plainer that you can&rsquo;t be stirred
from the truth. To look at life and say love is to
establish immortality. To look at what is hidden
or doubtful and say love is only to open the eyes
of the blind. To look at profits and say love is
only to lead the way to the commune. How can
we escape love? Love is the only life. To bask
in the daylight and say love is only to lead to the
<a id="page-118" class="pagenum" title="118"></a>
sun. You look at men. You say men are your
brothers. Is that as if we said: Now let us all
melt away in each other? To say brother is only
to say law. To say brother is only to say that we
have discovered a consequence as well as a cause.
To say that love will leave nothing to be done is
as if one said the loyalty of a planet to its orbit
leaves nothing to be done. Love is not an end.
It is only a beginning. We begin to live when
we begin to love. And as long as we continue
to love we will continue to begin. Love is not
the violation of law. It is the observance of
law. Life derives its joint and sinew from love.
Love is getting along together. Whether between
earths or people, getting along together.
Why should getting along together be worse than
getting along apart? Why should we suspect
that worlds that are loyal to their foundations
are less likely to resist the northwind than worlds
that are built upon quicksands? To say no love
is to say no life. For being alive is not life. Simply
going about your business, simply making
money, simply eating and drinking, even if you
are a whole animal, is not life. To hold back
love supposing it may go too far is like holding
back life supposing there may be too much life.
We will achieve all that love may see. Then
love will see more. We will go with love to complete
love. Then we will go farther. Eternally
farther. As with life. Living life into the remotest
distances only to recognize unceasing farther
obligations. There will always be more to
do than ever has been done. There will always
be more life coming than ever has arrived. There
<a id="page-119" class="pagenum" title="119"></a>
will always be more love needed than ever can be
expressed. To fear that love may love too much
is to fear that life may live too much. Love is
the law of life. To fear love is to fear life. Loving
is the only life because living together is the
only life. Because being together is inevitable.
Oceans and hills and people: being together.
Rain and the seed and the soil: being together.
Black and white and red: being together. A
man, a woman, child: being together. Love is
being together. The lake, the house on the shore,
the hermit: being together. Yesterday, to-day,
to-morrow: being together. Love gets the obstructions
out of the way of life. Gives living
time for life. Gets the wars out of the way. Gets
the poverties and the properties out of the way.
Gives the harvest a chance to mature. Makes
the ascent possible. Clears the way for the pauseless
procession. For all forever. Loving is the
only life.

KEEP YOUR FACE TO THE SUN
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">K</span><span class="postfirstchar">eep</span> your face to the sun. As the day goes
down let your cheer go up. The reminiscence
of the light will last through the darkness. Do
not lean upon what you absorb. Depend upon
what you bestow. Meet the sufficient noonglare
with a haughtier illumination. Do not reject
sorrow. Do not shut your door in its face. Invite
it in. Make it feel at home. The heart in
which sorrow is an alien misses its most sacred
tenant. You will not make sorrow the master
of the house. But you will include sorrow among
your guests. The purport of the house is joy.
The purport of the house is health. The earth
may pass into a cloud. But the purport of the
earth is not the cloud. Things go wrong. But
the purport of things is right. You see injustices.
You see victims. You see shipwrecks. But the
purport of experience is righteousness, deliverance,
salvation. No matter which way I look I
keep the sun in my face. Just as though looking
into hell I keep heaven in my face. Just as though
looking at cruelty I keep kindness in my face.
Just as though looking at the struggle I keep the
victory in my face. I am haunted with presences
which arm me with peace. There is evil.
We cant explain it. But there is good, too. And
we cant explain good. I do not wait for the
universe to explain itself. For love to argue its
case. Maybe the universe cant be explained.
Maybe love cant be argued about. Why should
I put question marks into the sky in place of
<a id="page-122" class="pagenum" title="122"></a>
stars? It is my main business to live. To live
nearest the best life I can discover. To live nearest
the natural laws. To live nearest people. Not
to ask for preferences. Not to expect odds. To
live. To spread power. To confer exhilaration.
To let the sun shine out of my face. For enough
reasons or for no reason at all to let the sun
shine. Taking the sun for granted. Taking the
best for granted even in the face of the worst.
Not being afraid that when the clock runs down
it can never be started again. Expecting surpluses
but being satisfied with shortages. Taking
fame if it comes and humbling myself with it.
Not reaching out for honors which do not belong
to me. Letting the honors go or stay. Keeping
sacred counsel with my own soul. Letting the
returns take care of themselves. Shedding the
light. Not sneaking about the earth as if life
had to be hid away or enjoyed in the dark. Not
snarling at men as if they had to be barked into
kennels. Not going among men with discounts.
Going among men with premiums. Adding a
little to everything I come near to or look at. A
little more love. A little more justice. A little
more loyalty. A little more resolution. I have
no logic for my joy. But I have joy for it. Or
for my affection for you. But I have you for it.
Or for my devotion to the great cause. But I
have the great cause for it. I can cite no justifications.
But I can cite my comrades. I cite
myself. I cite you. I cite the books I read. I
cite the struggle against money. They are
enough. They are sun enough for me. They explain
enough. Love explains enough though it
<a id="page-123" class="pagenum" title="123"></a>
dont explain at all. The cause explains enough
though it dont explain at all. And the abounding
light: it too explains enough. The vast interstreaming
dazzle of noontime: it explains
nothing but it explains enough. I who question
so much am silent. I who doubt so much accept.
I who love so much do not ask for pay. Keep
your face to the sun. A greater sun may shine
in your face.
</p>

<p>
Keep your face to the sun. No matter what
comes between keep your face to the sun. When
your salary comes between. When the contempt
of your enemies and the fear of your friends
come between. When ruin comes between. No
matter what may come between. Keep your face
to the sun. You will be driven and warned. You
will be despised and tempted. You will be misunderstood.
You will be summoned into courts
of public prejudice. You will be asked the questions
of reaction and disease. But you will keep
your face to the sun. Though the sun goes in
behind a cloud will keep your face to the sun.
Though the sun fails to get into your picture will
keep your picture to the sun. When you take an
office and the office is between. When you have
ambitions that come between. When cowardice
comes between. When praise comes between.
When even the love of your dearest comrade
comes between. You will keep your face to the
sun. I do not promise you fruit without the seed
of the fruit. You will plant. And much that you
plant may come to nothing in the ground. Though
it may come to much in your heart. You will
pour out property. Give the last cent. Go
<a id="page-124" class="pagenum" title="124"></a>
stripped, utterly shorn, into the contest. But
you will keep your face to the sun. Yes: you
will despair. You will say you dont see why
you should keep up the fight. You will want to
sell your birthright. You will grudge men success.
You will travel where no eye can chart
the way. You will taste the bitterest defeat.
You will be jealous and cruel. Your brute self
will stand between you and the sun. Yet you
will always stand with your face to the sun. I do
not suppose anything malign comes to any man
which may not just as well come to you. That
no disappointment can come. That no tragedy
can come. That you too may lose fortunes. May
lose more than fortunes. May lose hope. May
lose relation with the cosmos. That you too may
be cut adrift from the crowd. May be crushed
by the law. May have your trust violated. May
be deceived. May read the promises of faith
backward. May challenge justice. May go in
for the abolition of brotherhood. May fool the
prophets. Things do go wrong in life though life
itself never goes wrong. Events do conspire
against the plans of men. But they do not conspire
against men. We have to take all into account.
All the momentary repulses. We often
ride a very roundabout course to victory. A course
through disappointment. A course through direct
losses. A course over bad roads. Encountering
the devious motives of our companions.
Do you keep your face to the sun? No matter
which way you go you may keep your face to
the sun. East or west or north or south or up or
down or across it is all the same. You may keep
<a id="page-125" class="pagenum" title="125"></a>
your face to the sun. Your face shining with a
light all its own. Your face baffling all rivalries
of solar glory. You who ride to death may ride
to life. You may turn your back to the sun.
But the sun never turns its back to you. You
may turn your back to the soul. The soul never
turns its back to you. You may scorn the sentiment
of man. You may make light of the romance
of lovers. You may look with disdain
upon the ignorant and the stupid. You may take
care of yourself at the expense of others. You
may postpone or destroy the impulse to give.
Your life may be a life of seizure and appropriation.
May ride shod rough over the crowd. May
accept every advantage of position. Every advantage
of culture. Not acquiescing in the general
liberties. Flourishing your gifts like clubs.
Demanding awe and worship. Quoting your
money or your genius as evidence of your superiority.
Standing aside when the people invite
you to serve. Pulling back when the people
try to go on. Being satisfied with your surplus
when the people have too little to eat and
too little to wear. This may be your burden.
This may be your bloodred sin. This may be
your rack. You may shrink from the sun. Your
face may turn the other way. May prefer the
darkness of possession to the light of atonement.
Your eyes may be weak. May not be able to
stand the sunbeams. May take no sun in and
have no sun to give out. Your eyes may endure
tyranny but not endure freedom. May endure
seeing labor suffer but not endure seeing labor
enfranchised. May endure their inheritance but
<a id="page-126" class="pagenum" title="126"></a>
not endure their vista. This is the tragedy of the
pilgrim. He passes across the earth. The path
is often dark and uncertain. Often he has to feel,
because he cannot see, his way through. Then he
is driven back upon his conclusions. What are
his conclusions? Conclusions of triumph or conclusions
of disaster? Conclusions for one or conclusions
for all? Conclusions of property or conclusions
of the soul? In the eclipse of reason all
depends upon the conclusions. In the disappearance
of all you have seen all depends upon the
appearance of what you have not seen. What
are your conclusions? When all resource gives
out. When the road seems to end. When faculty
and vision have lost the impulse of appeal.
Then all depends upon the conclusion. The conclusion
to abandon all gobetweens and trust yourself
to the soul. The conclusion to refuse all
preferments and trust yourself to the people.
The conclusion to face the sun even if it blind you.
The conclusion to meet sun with sun. The splendid
sun sufficing for the love of the body with the
sun more splendid sufficing for the love of the
spirit.
</p>

<p>
Keep your face to the sun. I love you, O sun.
But I too am a sun. Sometimes I think I light
you: that you dont light me. That I each day
rekindle your expiring fires. That if I did not
come up in the morning you would not come up.
That you do not appear at the horizon greeting
the world. That I appear. That you do not
cross the heavens glorifying your unrivalled passage
and sanctifying your retrospect with the
matchless twilight. That I cross the heavens.
<a id="page-127" class="pagenum" title="127"></a>
That all the majesty and the wonder inheres to
me. That I do not depend upon you. That you
depend upon me. That Persia did not worship
you. That Persia worshipped me. That after all
you are only the form while I am the substance.
That you might be blotted out. That no harm
would come to man. But that if I was blotted
out the fate of man would be sealed in annihilation.
That I have ejected you from the heavens
and assumed your place. That you no longer
rule, godstrong on a celestial throne. That I
rule, man-potent in the hum of the common
street. That the farms and the orchards do not
look to you for fructification. That they look to
me. That all harvests are my harvests.
Harvests of fields as well as harvests of hearts.
Harvests of justice as well as harvests of things.
Harvests of ideals as well as harvests of deeds.
That the supreme life is not there with you in
the orbits of the heavens. That they are here
with me in the twists and turns of alleys and
pikes. I see now O sun that it is important to
be a sun but that it is more important to be a
man. That it is right to shine like a sun but that
it is more than right to shine like a lover. That
everything whatever seen or unseen is great and
awes me. But that there is something neither
seen nor unseen that stirs me to mightier results.
That it is no mistake to make much of your
genial flame: that you give life without question
and cannot be denied your pay. That it is still
less a mistake to make more of my precedent
endowments: that they give ampler life without
question and cannot be denied their pay. The
<a id="page-128" class="pagenum" title="128"></a>
pay of the sun is the pay of the crops. Is the
pay of houses. Is the pay of dividends. Is the
pay of profit and loss. The pay of my dreams is the
pay of love. Is the pay of men and women and
children. Is the pay of immortality. I too O sun
get down on my knees to you. I too O sun stand
erect honoring you. I too O sun gather with the
crowds acknowledging your first causes. I too
O sun let no rival shame my tribute. I too O
sun call you God. And you, O sun, do you realizing
yourself admit me? You too O sun: do you
get down on your knees honoring me? Do you
O sun gathering with the stars and the wheat and
the factories acknowledge my first causes? Do
you O sun bringing tribute do as much for me
as any other and more? Do you O sun call me
God? I have said of you O sun: you feed my
body. Do you say of me O sun: you feed my
soul? I have said to my darling comrades the
lands and seas over gasping for life: Keep your
face to the sun. I have said to them: No matter
what happens, no matter for barbarism and murder,
no matter for robbery and starvation, no
matter for yawning perditions, keep your face
to the sun. And I say to you O sun subtracting
no atom from the sum of your illimitability:
Keep your face to me. Comrades: Come: assemble
yourselves about me. The first word shall be
the last word and the last word the first word
again: Keep your face to the sun.

POETRY
</p>

<p class="ads">
A MAGAZINE OF VERSE
</p>

<p class="c">
Edited by Harriet Monroe, 543 Cass St., Chicago, Ill.
</p>

<p class="hang">
POETRY, at the end of its first year, is no longer an experiment
but an assured artistic success, a publication whose
importance is authoritatively recognized, not only in this
country, but in Great Britain and France as well. The
field it has opened up is full of brilliant possibilities, encouraging
the editors to hope for the enthusiastic support
of a discriminating public.
</p>

<p class="hang">
POETRY endeavors to present the best verse now being
written in English, quality alone being the test of acceptance.
</p>

<p class="hang">
POETRY is an effort to create an organ for the art. While
the ordinary magazines must minister to a large public
little interested in poetry, this magazine appeals to and
will develop a public primarily interested in poetry as
an art, potentially the highest, most complete human expression
of truth and beauty. Thus it offers to poets a
chance to be heard by their own audience, in their own
place, without the limitations imposed by the popular
magazines. And to lovers of poetry it offers each month
a sheaf of new verse in delicate form uninterrupted by
prose articles demanding a different mood.

CHANTS COMMUNAL
</p>

<p class="ada">
By HORACE TRAUBEL
</p>

<p class="adp">
Boards, $1.00 net. Paper, 30 cents postpaid.
</p>

<p>
Inspirational prose pieces fired by revolutionary idealism and prophetically
subtle in their vision. The high esteem in which Traubel&rsquo;s
work is held is attested by the following unusual commendations:
</p>

<p>
<b>Mildred Bain</b>: &ldquo;In &lsquo;Chants Communal&rsquo; we have some of the most
magnificent poetry which has ever accompanied a historic movement of
thought. These songs may well be termed scriptural. They are the very
heart beat of humanity. Such powerful exhortations, such fiercely tender
pleadings are in them. They are religious in the deepest, broadest sense.
Every one of them is a call to the higher self in man; is instinct with
the consciousness of the sacredness of life in its human every-day aspects.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<b>Jack London</b>: &ldquo;His is the vision of the poet and the voice of
the poet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<b>Eugene V. Debs</b>: &ldquo;Traubel is a philosopher, a poet, and a prophet;
he has produced a volume of literature&mdash;the literature of life and love,
of freedom and joy, and of universal social redemption.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<b>Clarence Darrow</b>: &ldquo;Horace Traubel is both a poet and a philosopher.
No one can say anything too good about him or his work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<b>George D. Herron</b>: &ldquo;It is a book of the highest value and beauty
that Horace Traubel proposes to give us, and I can only hope that it
will be read as widely and appreciatively as it more than deserves to be;
for it is with a joy that would seem extravagant, if I expressed it, that
I welcome &lsquo;Chants Communal.&rsquo;&rdquo;
